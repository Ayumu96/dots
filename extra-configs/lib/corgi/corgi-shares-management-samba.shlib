# corgi-shares-management-samba.shlib - Functions used to describe and connect to samba shares, 
#                                       using samba, smbclient, and udevil as backends.

# v2015.07.17
#
# Authored by Antonio Malcolm
#
# Requires: corgi-posix-core.shlib
# Requires: findsmb - if we want to find available samba shares broadcast by hosts
# Requires: smbclient - if we want to find and connect to samba shares
# Requires: cifs-utils - if we want to mount samba shares
# Requires: udevil - if we want to mount samba shares (allows us to mount without sudo)
# Requires: zenity - if we plan on connecting to authenticated samba shares - used for entering addresses and passwords,
#                    as well as confirmation and error prompts, as well as notifications, in the absence of notify-send
# Optional: libnotify - used for informational and success notifications
