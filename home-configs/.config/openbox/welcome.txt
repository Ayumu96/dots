<big><b>Welcome to ArchLabs Live Session!</b></big>

This 'Live' operating system allows you to test ArchLabs without making any changes to your
computer's hard drive. Among other things, it can be used to check hardware compatibility
(your network connection, monitor, keyboard, etc...), to perform system recovery or to work
anonymously on a public computer.


Keyboard shortcuts for some common applications are listed on the desktop
('Super' is also called the Windows key or Meta).
Right-click the desktop to access the system Main Menu, or use the keyboard shortcut shown.

Your username is '<b>user</b>' and your password is '<b>archlabs</b>'.
You already have sudo permissions.

To install ArchLabs to your hard-disk right click on the desktop and select 'Install ArchLabs'.



					Thank you for trying <b>ArchLabs Linux</b>!
