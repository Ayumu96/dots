Feb 06 12:10:13 <dobbie>	its probably the best move.
Feb 06 12:10:17 <unix121>	we can create a public one for people to join for AL info/questions
Feb 06 12:10:24 <unix121>	manjaro have one at #manjaro
Feb 06 12:10:36 <unix121>	where you go for fast assistance with issues
Feb 06 12:10:39 <dobbie>	okay thats worth adding.  Now to get the rest of the team here
Feb 06 12:11:15 <iDanoo>	I reckon this is probably best to keep public cause of the name.
Feb 06 12:11:34 <dobbie>	there is anarchlabs dev one, #archlabs-dev
Feb 06 12:11:35 *	iDanoo has changed the topic to: ArchLabs linux!

Feb 06 12:13:26 <dobbie>	how about just using the archlabs-dev channel that is already in place?  We made it ages ago

Feb 06 18:34:06 <Drakken>	hola dobbie
Feb 06 18:34:30 <dobbie>	Hows things
Feb 06 18:35:04 <Drakken>	good good, trying to sort out archlabs after years with #!. you?
Feb 06 18:35:42 <dobbie>	Most excellent.  Along with some of the other guys, trying to transfer the AL domain 
Feb 06 18:39:18 <Drakken>	hosting issues? That sucks
Feb 06 18:39:27 <Drakken>	where are you trying to move too?
Feb 06 18:39:37 <dobbie>	Just moving away from Wordpress and hosting it ourselves
Feb 06 18:40:01 <dobbie>	crazydomains, 
Feb 06 18:40:15 <dobbie>	Sam is going to host this on his derver
Feb 06 18:40:17 <dobbie>	server
Feb 06 18:40:20 <Drakken>	ah nice.. can't blame y'all there. wordpress kinda blows
Feb 06 18:40:35 <dobbie>	LOL you wouldn't believe how many times I have heard that today
Feb 06 18:40:52 <Drakken>	dude. I worked for rackspace.. I know :D
Feb 06 18:40:58 <dobbie>	hahaha
Feb 06 18:41:33 <Drakken>	I am loving this archbang vib..
Feb 06 18:41:55 <Drakken>	Makes me remember my times on #!. Y'all hit it on the had with this distro
Feb 06 18:42:06 <Drakken>	the best of arch and a omage to #!
Feb 06 18:42:31 <Drakken>	Gonna get my Plank and Tint2 settngs tweaks on.
Feb 06 18:42:46 <dobbie>	Thanks man, sort of what we were aiming for.  Originally we wanted to clone BunsenLabs to Arch, then we just developed from there
Feb 06 18:43:18 <dobbie>	Polybar is my favourite panel, you don't need to bother with Conky really using it
Feb 06 18:44:35 <Drakken>	Bunsen and #!++ have a good thought in mind. But I am liking this more.. Gonna have to see what kind of printer support y'all have rolled in. If not? I will add a break-fix for my printer.
Feb 06 18:45:16 <dobbie>	If you ran the AL-Hello you should have had the printer option.
Feb 06 18:46:37 <Drakken>	indeed I did.. just getting to know this distro. Played with it awhile for a few on a VM.Finally decided to install it on my x220.
Feb 06 18:47:11 <dobbie>	Nice work.  I'm super happy with how it has turned out.  Smoke/Nate has done wonders with what we started with
Feb 06 18:48:19 <Drakken>	aye, I agree.. I was left wanting after #! was left to the nethers.. To bring it back with arch? This is awesome
Feb 06 18:49:16 <dobbie>	Brett who kicked AL off with me, always said that this would be huge.  It
Feb 06 18:49:26 <dobbie>	It's sort of heading in the right direction
Feb 06 18:49:27 <Drakken>	quick question. Does installing Nitrogen breack setting backgrounds?
Feb 06 18:49:36 <dobbie>	No nitorgen is default
Feb 06 18:49:49 <Drakken>	shweet thanks!
Feb 06 18:49:55 <dobbie>	:)
Feb 06 18:50:07 <dobbie>	Where in the world are you?
Feb 06 18:50:31 <Drakken>	I have no doubt Brett seams to have the right idea. This itteration is the coder's paradice
Feb 06 18:50:34 <Drakken>	Tx
Feb 06 18:50:43 <dobbie>	Yup well I hope so :)
Feb 06 18:50:51 <dobbie>	An nice. I am in little on New Zealand
Feb 06 18:50:55 <dobbie>	on = old
Feb 06 18:51:05 <dobbie>	I am in typist hell today.
Feb 06 18:51:09 <dobbie>	so many typos
Feb 06 18:51:26 <Drakken>	I have more than a few kiwi's that I call friends :D
Feb 06 18:51:51 <dobbie>	Oh nice, we seem to be everywhere :D
Feb 06 18:52:25 <Drakken>	aye.. there where a few from the old guard on #! that were from New Zeland and Aussie
Feb 06 18:52:47 <dobbie>	Yup, those bloody Aussies.
Feb 06 18:52:54 <dobbie>	I do miss #!
Feb 06 18:52:57 <Drakken>	There is still a channel on freenode. but it is more about reminising.
Feb 06 18:53:04 <dobbie>	what was your user name at the forum?
Feb 06 18:53:13 <dobbie>	Are any of the BL guys on there?
Feb 06 18:53:43 <Drakken>	No, they are not. There was a huge blow up a few years ago after
Feb 06 18:53:56 <Drakken>	After Chorm said his goodbye

Feb 06 18:54:04 <Drakken>	that is when thing started to go south
Feb 06 18:55:08 <dobbie>	Ah yeah, that wasn't a hugely public thing but I gathered some shit went down
Feb 06 18:55:42 <dead1>	what ,praytell, went dpwm
Feb 06 18:55:53 <Drakken>	yeah..and I was a part of it.. I was young, stupid and pissed about it all at the time
Feb 06 18:56:23 <dobbie>	Ah shit we all do dumb stuff.  Even recently I took out some steam on the archmerge people...
Feb 06 18:56:34 <Drakken>	tis the past. it does not matter now unless y'all ask me to help with this shweet distro
Feb 06 18:56:46 <dobbie>	is Dead1 happen to be DP, A.K.A. the Canadian Rapper?
Feb 06 18:57:04 <Drakken>	I have no idea man
Feb 06 18:57:09 <dobbie>	we like help, the more the better
Feb 06 18:58:20 <Drakken>	all I can tell you is there was the bunsenlabs cats which were twat waffles in my hindsight and the #!++ cats that I really wanted to help.. But life happened and I could not. I still feel bad about that
Feb 06 19:00:48 <dobbie>	I have found the BL guys to be utterly brilliant, them giving their blessing for us to basically outright copy them meant a lot.  They have been super supportive too
Feb 06 19:01:14 <dobbie>	I have had absolutely nothing to do with the #!++ dudes
Feb 06 19:01:52 <Drakken>	no shit?
Feb 06 19:02:13 <dobbie>	Never used #!++, I just fell in with the BL boys and really gone from there
Feb 06 19:02:34 <Drakken>	well then you learn something new everday.
Feb 06 19:02:43 <dobbie>	lol
Feb 06 19:03:07 <Drakken>	those times where hot, and there was a lot of back and forth going on. Thank you dobbie
Feb 06 19:03:16 <dobbie>	Head_on_a_Stick, damo, Sector11 are top, top blokes
Feb 06 19:04:14 <Drakken>	I think I might have talked to Secto11 over irc. But do not quote me. On the either side of the pond from you.
Feb 06 19:04:36 <dobbie>	He's in Argentina. Originally Canada
Feb 06 19:05:33 <Drakken>	then not the cat I am thinking about. Was a guy I wanted to work with on something like this that never happened
Feb 06 19:05:55 <dobbie>	Wasn't Toola by chance?
Feb 06 19:06:26 <Drakken>	naw it was a cat what was working on arch-anywhere
Feb 06 19:06:39 <dobbie>	Dylan James?
Feb 06 19:07:56 <Drakken>	nope a gent that was working on API integration between Fedora and Arch
Feb 06 19:08:13 <dobbie>	okay I am out of names lol
Feb 06 19:08:33 <Drakken>	no worries.. Tis IT
Feb 06 19:08:42 <dobbie>	indeed.
Feb 06 19:08:47 <dobbie>	Man I am needing some food
Feb 06 19:11:15 <dobbie>	dead1, hello
Feb 06 19:13:28 <dobbie>	Holy shit, just read an article saying Best Buy are stopping the sale of CD's.
Feb 06 19:15:48 <Drakken>	and you are suprised why?
Feb 06 19:16:40 *	Drakken has quit (Remote host closed the connection)

Feb 07 17:46:47 <dobbie>	Good man, work is over and I can relax
Feb 07 17:46:54 <smokeking>	I cant for the life of me figure out how to generate the grub config
Feb 07 17:47:02 <smokeking>	without it missing other OS's
Feb 07 17:47:16 <smokeking>	Then I do the exact same thing on reboot
Feb 07 17:47:49 <smokeking>	and it works fine and finds the other distro
Feb 07 17:47:49 <smokeking>	Weird as hell, and annoying
Feb 07 17:48:07 <dobbie>	That's weird man, its like it needs to almost lock the new distro in place with a reboot before it will recognise anything else
Feb 07 17:48:28 <smokeking>	not sure why that would be
Feb 07 17:48:38 <smokeking>	or rahter
Feb 07 17:48:48 <smokeking>	why does calamares etc mnot have this issue
Feb 07 17:49:05 <smokeking>	Do i need to mount everything

Feb 07 17:50:20 <dobbie>	Shall we fall back to Calamares, let's leave ABIF on there as an option?  Have two options in the menu and you can choose which one you'd prefer
Feb 07 17:50:37 <dobbie>	have a discalimer saying that a reboot is required for multiboot with ABIF?
Feb 07 17:51:00 <smokeking>	I feel like you dont care what any of this puts me.. the maintainer through

Feb 07 18:05:29 <smokeking>	https://pastebin.com/Hsjw9kJP
Feb 07 18:05:37 <smokeking>	and there is a totally finished one
Feb 07 18:06:09 <smokeking>	Notice!! there isnt anything but the top section changed
Feb 07 18:06:24 <smokeking>	It cant really get much simpler if I tried
Feb 07 18:06:27 <dobbie>	Yup, ah fuck I see now
Feb 07 18:07:10 <smokeking>	yea, it's just the apps and corosponding pretty names
Feb 07 18:07:29 <smokeking>	so the command will be gimp, pretty name is Gimp
Feb 07 18:07:54 <smokeking>	only thing that matters is that they are in the same array position
Feb 07 18:08:02 <smokeking>	so if eg. gimp is first
Feb 07 18:08:16 <smokeking>	gimp's pretty name must be first in the other list
Feb 07 18:08:32 <smokeking>	and so on
Feb 07 18:08:34 <dobbie>	got ya
Feb 07 18:08:52 <smokeking>	I've got file stuff and graphic stuff done
Feb 07 18:09:11 <dobbie>	Cool, do you need to do one for each category?
Feb 07 18:09:15 <smokeking>	drawing a blank as to what else we need lol
Feb 07 18:09:20 <iDanoo>	Hmm speaking of this stuff.. anyway to add icons for apps in tint?
Feb 07 18:09:21 <smokeking>	yea, would be nice
Feb 07 18:09:29 <iDanoo>	Rambox / st / etc all have generic window icon
Feb 07 18:09:35 <smokeking>	yeas
Feb 07 18:09:44 <iDanoo>	Is it just the .desktop file?
Feb 07 18:09:47 <smokeking>	icons for which sorry Dan?

Feb 07 18:09:53 <smokeking>	yes
Feb 07 18:10:00 <smokeking>	but it can be overridden
Feb 07 18:10:06 <smokeking>	No worries
Feb 07 18:10:11 <dobbie>	Hey Smoke, check this mate https://scrot.moe/image/6d3hd
Feb 07 18:10:40 <iDanoo>	https://i.imgur.com/OpUocL2.png

Feb 07 18:10:56 <smokeking>	hmm
Feb 07 18:11:23 <smokeking>	I see dan
Feb 07 18:11:28 <iDanoo>	most things are sweet
Feb 07 18:11:37 <smokeking>	Some icons just arent providedd by some packs
Feb 07 18:12:03 <iDanoo>	hmm all good
Feb 07 18:12:15 <smokeking>	I wonder if switching to something like gnome icons or adwaita would have them
Feb 07 18:12:50 <smokeking>	The ones your missing are the terminal one, and looks like rambox
Feb 07 18:12:59 <dobbie>	smokeking: ignore that pic I sent you.  All okay
Feb 07 18:13:20 <smokeking>	Did you get it?
Feb 07 18:13:27 <smokeking>	I haven't seen that error before
Feb 07 18:13:35 <smokeking>	curios to say the least
Feb 07 18:14:05 <dobbie>	Im fucking dumb.  I have a crappy keyboard attached to the craptop and it arrowed down too much to the USB stick and I didn't see it before I moved on
Feb 07 18:14:22 <smokeking>	oh. haha, thank god
Feb 07 18:14:24 <smokeking>	I was like Fuuuck
Feb 07 18:14:29 <dobbie>	I was too
Feb 07 18:14:32 <smokeking>	LOL
Feb 07 18:14:55 <dobbie>	Just trying a LUKS install this time around
Feb 07 18:16:25 <smokeking>	I cleaned up and was editing the LUKS/LVM sections so fingers crossed i didnt fuck something up
Feb 07 18:17:17 <dobbie>	I've had a blow out, something about the encrypted partition already exists.  Just want to try again before I can confirm its a true blow out
Feb 07 18:17:58 <smokeking>	ok
Feb 07 18:18:19 <smokeking>	might wanna open up /tmp/.errlog side by side to see whats happening
Feb 07 18:18:36 <smokeking>	might give you some or 0 info haha
Feb 07 18:19:50 <dobbie>	lol just trying again
Feb 07 18:20:18 <dobbie>	okay working now, it spazzed out at the unpack stage
Feb 07 18:20:23 <smokeking>	hey Dan, thats odd I get terminal icons for termite
Feb 07 18:20:23 <dobbie>	so far so good
Feb 07 18:20:29 <smokeking>	which terminal are you using?
Feb 07 18:21:02 <dobbie>	You might need to set the terminal icon in .Xresources? or does that just apply to URXVT?
Feb 07 18:21:19 <smokeking>	yea, just urxvt
Feb 07 18:21:24 <dobbie>	got ya
Feb 07 18:21:31 <smokeking>	and you need a certain version of urxvt for that to work
Feb 07 18:21:38 <smokeking>	rxvt-pixbuff
Feb 07 18:21:55 <dobbie>	Yep, that'll be the version I installed.
Feb 07 18:22:00 <smokeking>	yea
Feb 07 18:22:04 <smokeking>	st ftw XD
Feb 07 18:22:15 <iDanoo>	st is pretty damn nice
Feb 07 18:22:23 <iDanoo>	the only thing I can't get working is my del key
Feb 07 18:22:34 <iDanoo>	and copying more than the current page of text, can't scroll while selected
Feb 07 18:22:34 <dobbie>	st rules man, I have to keep recommending it because it is so good.
Feb 07 18:22:52 <iDanoo>	Other than that, it beats everything else hands down
Feb 07 18:22:53 <dobbie>	oh, del works here
Feb 07 18:22:54 <smokeking>	Dan, you can switch the delete key
Feb 07 18:22:59 <smokeking>	its known
Feb 07 18:23:20 <smokeking>	there is a small patch out there to switch to probably what you're used to
Feb 07 18:23:47 <smokeking>	https://st.suckless.org/patches/delkey/
Feb 07 18:24:23 <smokeking>	Scrollback with copy pasting on the other hand, hmm
Feb 07 18:29:10 <smokeking>	LOL, I know there is a way, cant find it
Feb 07 18:35:21 <dobbie>	Okay got a Grub error I think...got it both times with and without LUKS.  I get grub installed and then at the Configure ArchLabs base section it errors out with this 
Feb 07 18:35:57 <smokeking>	ok

Feb 07 18:38:33 <dobbie>	okay sweet...phew
Feb 07 18:38:37 <smokeking>	likely just not sending the grub stuff to the errorlog
Feb 07 18:38:59 <dobbie>	Shit wish I had another craptop to test on to make sure its not my craptop thats the issue
Feb 07 18:39:02 <smokeking>	its this
Feb 07 18:39:10 <smokeking>	grub-probe: error:
Feb 07 18:39:20 <smokeking>	the error keyword causes the flag to get set
Feb 07 18:39:34 <dobbie>	okay,

Feb 07 18:52:25 <iDanoo>	Nah haven't even looked yet, been sorting out a critical issue at work.
Feb 07 18:52:36 <iDanoo>	Interesting, I think I used rambox-bin

Feb 07 18:57:06 <iDanoo>	but boy does it make things quick
Feb 07 18:57:16 <iDanoo>	instead of hitting the database like 3,000+ times a minute, we hit redis, which is like < 1ms response time

Feb 10 07:53:34 <unix121>	I've seen something similar done with morcmenu
Feb 10 07:53:38 <smoke>	Would need to be done with something stronger than bash

Feb 10 07:53:59 <smoke>	John
Feb 10 07:54:08 <unix121>	mhm
Feb 10 07:54:13 <smoke>	He's got what he's calling 'modules'
Feb 10 07:54:20 <smoke>	So they can be whatever
Feb 10 07:54:30 <smoke>	He's got a small demo of it
Feb 10 07:54:33 <smoke>	Looks slick
Feb 10 07:54:40 <smoke>	Like a nicer whisker menu
Feb 10 07:54:45 <smoke>	with less clutter
Feb 10 07:54:55 <smoke>	see if I can find a link
Feb 10 07:55:01 <smoke>	We could do one for obmenu
Feb 10 07:55:14 <smoke>	just would need to be a standalone app essentially
Feb 10 07:55:31 <smoke>	and just spawn on the cursor or someshit
Feb 10 07:55:37 <smoke>	no clue
Feb 10 07:55:46 <unix121>	mhm it's written in C , yummy yummy
Feb 10 07:55:52 <unix121>	I was thinking about it because
Feb 10 07:56:01 <unix121>	you can bind bash scripts to run python natively
Feb 10 07:56:07 <smoke>	https://github.com/johanmalm/jgmenu/wiki/Widgets
Feb 10 07:56:16 <smoke>	yea
Feb 10 07:56:19 <unix121>	so it should be possible to do search via a bash script that calls python
Feb 10 07:56:33 <smoke>	but it's gonna be a fair bit of python
Feb 10 07:56:34 <smoke>	Ahh
Feb 10 07:56:49 <smoke>	Yea there are lots of FZF written in python already available
Feb 10 07:56:53 <smoke>	Hmm
Feb 10 07:57:08 <unix121>	I've written the prototype of my search engine in Python :P
Feb 10 07:57:12 <smoke>	Yea jgmenu is nice

Feb 10 07:58:44 <smoke>	https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
Feb 10 07:58:47 <smoke>	theres more
Feb 10 07:59:02 <smoke>	just a worth quick look at what others are doing
Feb 10 07:59:27 <smoke>	Nooo
Feb 10 07:59:32 <smoke>	it's written in goo
Feb 10 07:59:42 <smoke>	WElp

Feb 10 08:00:41 <smoke>	yea its very well known
Feb 10 08:00:53 <smoke>	lots of people use it and add on for their use case
Feb 10 08:01:03 <smoke>	theres fzf vim plugins etc out there
Feb 10 08:01:21 <smoke>	Why it came to mind

Feb 10 10:57:33 <unix121>	I tested it on string format
Feb 10 10:57:38 <unix121>	Is it not formated as string?
Feb 10 10:57:50 <iDanoo>	I have no idea at all.
Feb 10 10:58:02 <iDanoo>	I just copied some commands and hacked i up haha
Feb 10 10:58:21 <unix121>	ok I'm gonna install cloudbot and do it
Feb 10 10:58:32 <unix121>	because if it doesn't output anything then it's not formated as string :P
Feb 10 10:58:33 <smoke>	LOL
Feb 10 10:58:37 <unix121>	I only tested on string format
Feb 10 10:58:45 <smoke>	All of this for 4 fucking numbers

Feb 10 11:10:12 <smoke>	They merged so much shit into xorgproto

Feb 10 11:10:29 <iDanoo>	fuck sqamsqam you're probably right

Feb 10 11:11:11 <iDanoo>	oh wait, that's in php though
Feb 10 11:11:20 <sqamsqam>	pretty sure there is a better way to do it in python
Feb 10 11:11:39 <smoke>	yea
Feb 10 11:11:47 <iDanoo>	https://hastebin.com/utopakejox.php
Feb 10 11:11:50 <iDanoo>	lmao
Feb 10 11:11:55 <iDanoo>	nice
Feb 10 11:12:11 <sqamsqam>	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/606191/convert-bytes-to-a-string
Feb 10 11:12:31 <unix121>	I tried to regex it but it doesn't take it as a string
Feb 10 11:13:29 <unix121>	I'm actually curious now, becuase it's either a byte array, or a string 'b'...''
Feb 10 11:13:41 <unix121>	how do you output the var type in python lol
Feb 10 11:13:48 <sqamsqam>	will be a byte array
Feb 10 11:14:07 <sqamsqam>	can tell because of the b'...'
Feb 10 11:14:42 <unix121>	I tried to rstrip it and it doesn do it
Feb 10 11:14:47 <unix121>	so it should be a string
Feb 10 11:15:03 <unix121>	unless rstrip isn't string exclussive
Feb 10 11:15:13 <avnsgt[m]>	And now for the magical reboot to the famous black screen of death because they merged all of that crap.
Feb 10 11:15:59 <dobbie>	Check this conky dudes https://i.imgur.com/DxCBtXI.jpg

Feb 10 11:18:47 <dobbie>	Same for me mate, same for me
Feb 10 11:21:59 *	dpreacher has quit (Quit: Quit)
Feb 10 11:28:27 <iDanoo>	It's not a string unix121
Feb 10 11:28:37 <iDanoo>	because substringing the first char, doesn't take out the b, it takes out the 4
Feb 10 11:28:38 <iDanoo>	lol
Feb 10 11:36:18 <unix121>	try this: (i don't know if it's going to work)
Feb 10 11:36:34 <unix121>	add this before the extra code that I added
Feb 10 11:36:39 <unix121>	output = str( output )
Feb 10 11:36:55 <unix121>	it might be able to convert it to str
Feb 10 11:37:01 <unix121>	and then my code would work perfectly xD

Feb 10 11:55:44 <totes-not-a-bot>	unix121: Is it
Feb 10 11:55:47 <iDanoo>	Yeah if it can't string together a sentance, it'll stop at 2 words
Feb 10 11:55:55 <iDanoo>	sentence
Feb 10 11:56:04 <iDanoo>	So the longer things we post, the more it'll link things ;)
Feb 10 11:56:07 <unix121>	thats an easy fix
Feb 10 11:56:11 <iDanoo>	Also another thing I've heard
Feb 10 11:56:15 <iDanoo>	is people pump ebooks into the brain file

Feb 10 11:58:18 <smoke>	For what

Feb 10 12:03:02 <unix121>	I wish they were a bit bigger tho
Feb 10 12:03:09 <unix121>	maybe 25" would be the optimal
Feb 10 12:03:19 <smoke>	I wish I didnt give my bro my matching one
Feb 10 12:03:37 <iDanoo>	I've got a 27" and a 14" laptop screen >_>

Feb 10 12:51:32 <unix121>	fkn Facebook is locking me out of my account every time I log in through the VPN
Feb 10 12:51:41 <unix121>	it's getting stupid
Feb 10 13:05:00 <iDanoo>	haha its annoying eh
Feb 10 13:07:24 <unix121>	yeah , I don't own a phone so I have to verify through this stupid mechanism that makes you recognize friend's photos lol
Feb 10 13:08:18 <sqamsqam>	wot..
Feb 10 13:09:45 <unix121>	you've never had this on facebook?

Feb 10 13:16:32 <sqamsqam>	i go on facebook maybe 6 or 7 times a year
Feb 10 13:16:40 <unix121>	the free one was leaking data
Feb 10 13:17:05 <unix121>	oh good for you
Feb 10 13:17:22 <unix121>	I have it perma open, no-one of my irl friends use anything else for communication :P
Feb 10 13:17:26 <unix121>	and I don't own a phone xD
Feb 10 13:17:30 <unix121>	soooo
Feb 10 13:17:58 <iDanoo>	Yeaaaah, I use it at work mostly cause they block some crap we sometimes need
Feb 10 13:18:00 <iDanoo>	like imgur
Feb 10 13:18:03 <iDanoo>	and facebook
Feb 10 13:18:04 <iDanoo>	linkedin
Feb 10 13:18:07 <iDanoo>	haha
Feb 10 13:18:11 <iDanoo>	I mean.. cmon..
Feb 10 13:18:18 <iDanoo>	It was originally blocked for our support team i think
Feb 10 13:18:38 <iDanoo>	fuck it sqamsqam, i'm gonna work on some of my projects
Feb 10 13:19:09 <unix121>	oh by the was sqamswam , I tried out Fira and I was dissapointed :P
Feb 10 13:19:11 <iDanoo>	What do you reckon I should do as a front/backend
Feb 10 13:19:20 <iDanoo>	I'm almost thinking react + a php api
Feb 10 13:19:25 <unix121>	It turned the >> in C++ into a character like =>
Feb 10 13:20:02 <unix121>	react js has the word "java" in it :(
Feb 10 13:24:54 <iDanoo>	I knowww
Feb 10 13:24:59 <iDanoo>	but it's pretty good
Feb 10 13:25:12 <iDanoo>	I just want to split up front/backend
Feb 10 13:25:26 <iDanoo>	and api based makes this nice and clean
Feb 10 13:26:00 <iDanoo>	Or i could just smash out the entire thing in raw php/html haha
Feb 10 13:26:36 <unix121>	I have to slowly get into PHP myself as well
Feb 10 13:26:56 <unix121>	I have to build the main website that will send the queries to the C++ search engine
Feb 10 13:27:11 <unix121>	But I literally have no idea how to do this :P I've never worked with PHP seriously
Feb 10 13:32:12 <sqamsqam>	unix121: yeah some things look weird at first but i like them
Feb 10 13:32:58 <sqamsqam>	iDanoo: unix121 you guys should check out golang

Feb 10 13:33:59 <iDanoo>	one sec
Feb 10 13:34:14 <sqamsqam>	decent course to learn the basics of go
Feb 10 13:34:24 <sqamsqam>	there is a link in the video for his course for free
Feb 10 13:34:30 <sqamsqam>	its what ive been working through

Feb 10 13:36:38 <Minimo>	(iDanoo) The YouTube API is off in the Google Developers Console.
Feb 10 13:36:40 <iDanoo>	fuckit
Feb 10 13:36:46 <iDanoo>	might take awhile to take effect
Feb 10 13:37:09 <unix121>	I know some very basic GO from I book that I have
Feb 10 13:37:32 <unix121>	But I don't know if it's worth the time atm cause all I want is to get done with the search engine as soon as possible
Feb 10 13:37:41 <unix121>	learning a new lang would probs set me back a while
Feb 10 13:38:28 <sqamsqam>	main things i like about it are that the syntax is very clean and minimal. compiles to a static binary and has awesome performance
Feb 10 13:38:53 <sqamsqam>	means i can simply start a docker container with FROM scratch and copy in the go binary and it runs
Feb 10 13:39:00 <sqamsqam>	also it compiles fast as fuck
Feb 10 13:39:17 <sqamsqam>	probably faster then it takes php to server a page
Feb 10 13:39:27 <unix121>	I know that it's supposed to be like the "Python of the future" or something
Feb 10 13:39:50 <unix121>	and there are some good variations to it that I like
Feb 10 13:57:51 <smoke>	totes-not-a-bot: when were you born?

Feb 10 14:34:45 <unix121>	oh by the way do you want my help with anything else?
Feb 10 14:34:50 <unix121>	i need something to do
Feb 10 14:35:16 <smoke>	haha, possibly

Feb 10 14:36:23 <unix121>	i have no plans on sleeping tonight
Feb 10 14:37:03 <smoke>	LOL
Feb 10 14:37:16 <smoke>	lemme see
Feb 10 14:38:37 <smoke>	I'm trying to have this installer mount any remaining partitions before running the grub-mkconfig
Feb 10 14:38:46 <smoke>	just brain dead as hell today
Feb 10 14:39:35 <unix121>	literally me every day
Feb 10 14:39:58 <unix121>	i can't even speak properly most of the days
Feb 10 14:40:54 <smoke>	Hahaha
Feb 10 14:42:09 <unix121>	i'm gonna lurk around in the repos trying to find some meaning for my life man
Feb 10 14:43:52 <smoke>	Do it
Feb 10 14:44:08 <unix121>	https://github.com/ARCHLabs/Archlabs-User-Home/blob/master/home/.config/i3/config
Feb 10 14:44:16 <unix121>	line 44
Feb 10 14:44:18 <unix121>	why man, why
Feb 10 14:44:40 <unix121>	2 empty lines :'(
Feb 10 14:44:46 <smoke>	Hahaha
Feb 10 14:44:49 <smoke>	I was like wtf
Feb 10 14:45:34 <smoke>	oh god
Feb 10 14:45:36 <unix121>	oh man i was meant to recommend it for a while
Feb 10 14:45:39 <smoke>	and a trailing blank line
Feb 10 14:45:50 <unix121>	reloading compton on every reload of i3 is not optimal
Feb 10 14:45:55 <unix121>	it causes screen tearing
Feb 10 14:46:15 <unix121>	I know from personal experience, like the 3rd time you reload compton you are fucked :P
Feb 10 14:46:56 <smoke>	I didnt know that
Feb 10 14:47:24 <unix121>	you can test it yourself, I used to do it in the past
Feb 10 14:47:36 <unix121>	also you will notice that some times it will not load shadows if you reload it
Feb 10 14:47:38 <smoke>	I do
Feb 10 14:47:49 <smoke>	I think it may be driver dependant
Feb 10 14:48:03 <smoke>	I always reload it, never had issues
Feb 10 14:48:32 <smoke>	might also depend on the settings and that
Feb 10 14:48:57 <smoke>	We can ditch it though, saves me having to keep a shitty bash wrapper
Feb 10 14:48:57 <unix121>	ye I don't know, compton is kinda fucked
Feb 10 14:49:03 <smoke>	Oh
Feb 10 14:49:05 <smoke>	yea
Feb 10 14:49:19 <smoke>	I also run a minor patched version of my own
Feb 10 14:49:31 <unix121>	I think I'll give compiz a test drive soon, I've read that it's better
Feb 10 14:49:47 <smoke>	Yea, but it's like its own wm and everything
Feb 10 14:49:59 <smoke>	you need emerald as far as I know
Feb 10 14:50:38 <unix121>	yeah, but you can do insane things for eye candy :P
Feb 10 14:50:49 <unix121>	althought idgaf about eye candy :P
Feb 10 14:50:56 <unix121>	I only want some shadows for depth :P
Feb 10 14:51:09 <smoke>	I like it within reason
Feb 10 14:51:41 <smoke>	shadows are kinda needed for visibility, unless you literally never have a floating window
Feb 10 14:53:18 <unix121>	i see all those people on unixpor who run openbox without shadows and I'm like wtf
Feb 10 14:53:23 <unix121>	it's toooooo flat for me
Feb 10 14:53:33 <unix121>	like the gf i had in highschool
Feb 10 14:53:38 <smoke>	Like I said though, go nuts man. I'll merge whatever if you've got a PR or I can get ya push capability if you'd prefer
Feb 10 14:54:05 <unix121>	it's fine, I'll just clone all I need and make PRs
Feb 10 14:54:11 <unix121>	I have the ability to merge prs I think
Feb 10 14:54:13 <unix121>	so it's the same
Feb 10 14:57:18 <iDanoo>	lol I see people run borderless with no shadows
Feb 10 14:57:19 <iDanoo>	im like
Feb 10 14:57:22 <iDanoo>	where does this terminal end?!
Feb 10 14:57:29 <smoke>	LOL
Feb 10 14:57:33 <smoke>	Legit
Feb 10 14:58:08 <smoke>	I like 5-10px gap
Feb 10 14:58:26 <smoke>	makes things so much easier to switch between in my mind
Feb 10 15:00:44 <smoke>	Yea wait wtf
Feb 10 15:01:00 <smoke>	You're on our github team, you dont need my ass
Feb 10 15:03:04 <unix121>	yeap
Feb 10 15:03:15 <unix121>	I run borderless on terminal like 90% of the time :P
Feb 10 15:03:21 <unix121>	but never gapless
Feb 10 15:03:25 <unix121>	it's so fucking bad
Feb 10 15:03:29 <smoke>	I mean
Feb 10 15:03:29 <dobbie>	Yeah all my terminals are borderless :D
Feb 10 15:03:39 <smoke>	yea
Feb 10 15:03:45 <smoke>	on ob that makes sense
Feb 10 15:04:05 <smoke>	unless you have ridiculus borders it's kinda pointless on i3
Feb 10 15:04:12 <unix121>	dobbie: listen to the new album by Graw their Tongues man :P it's epic
Feb 10 15:04:16 <smoke>	Gaps atleast
Feb 10 15:04:43 <dobbie>	unix121: I have mate, pretty good stuff
Feb 10 15:04:52 <unix121>	well if you are on i3-gaps you literally have to go without titlebars by default
Feb 10 15:05:03 <unix121>	nice man
Feb 10 15:05:10 <smoke>	Yea
Feb 10 15:05:11 <unix121>	borders I just don't generally like anymore
Feb 10 15:17:07 <smoke>	I wonder if I just mount everything in /mnt will if fuck anything
Feb 10 15:17:18 <smoke>	LOL
Feb 10 15:22:01 <iDanoo>	hahaa
Feb 10 15:36:39 <smoke>	I think I'm gonna tempt it
Feb 10 15:36:54 <smoke>	'What the worst that could happen'
Feb 10 15:37:51 <unix121>	.8ball will he fuck it up?
Feb 10 15:37:52 *	Minimo shakes the magic 8 ball... My sources say no
Feb 10 15:37:55 <unix121>	good
Feb 10 15:38:12 <avnsgt[m]>	No means Yes.
Feb 10 15:39:46 <smoke>	Hahahah
Feb 10 15:42:31 <smoke>	wait
Feb 10 15:42:40 <smoke>	If I'm mounting in a chroot
Feb 10 15:42:50 <smoke>	I can mount in /mnt/mnt
Feb 10 15:42:56 <smoke>	mnt-ception
Feb 10 15:44:31 <avnsgt[m]>	If you are are in chroot, you can have a temp mount on in mnt, unless you add it to the final fstab manually. I don't think the genfstab will pick it up.
Feb 10 15:45:09 <smoke>	I dont even want the genfstab to pick it up, just the grub config generation
Feb 10 15:45:31 <smoke>	I'm personally not even sure it'll work then XD
Feb 10 15:45:46 <smoke>	worth a throw away test though
Feb 10 15:45:53 <avnsgt[m]>	Then you don't need to /mnt/mnt
Feb 10 15:46:00 <smoke>	I was just trolling
Feb 10 15:46:02 <smoke>	XD
Feb 10 15:46:08 <avnsgt[m]>	lol
Feb 10 15:46:23 <smoke>	It was too silly to not bring up
Feb 10 15:47:49 <avnsgt[m]>	Still think we need a Rick Sanchez bot.
Feb 10 15:48:00 <smoke>	hahah, yes
Feb 10 15:50:52 <smoke>	Morty
Feb 10 15:51:07 <smoke>	He has to burp at some interval
Feb 10 15:51:09 <smoke>	LOL
Feb 10 15:51:30 <avnsgt[m]>	.8Ball Will we get a Rick Sanchez bot?
Feb 10 15:51:30 *	Minimo shakes the magic 8 ball... Don't count on it
Feb 10 15:52:08 <smoke>	RIP sanchez bot
Feb 10 15:52:12 <unix121>	So that basically means yes right?
Feb 10 15:52:22 <smoke>	Hahaha, by it's logic, yes
Feb 10 15:53:17 <avnsgt[m]>	.8Ball Is no equal to yes?
Feb 10 15:53:18 *	Minimo shakes the magic 8 ball... One would be wise to think so
Feb 10 15:53:21 <unix121>	.8ball will I marry Shakira?
Feb 10 15:53:21 *	Minimo shakes the magic 8 ball... Don't count on it
Feb 10 15:53:25 <unix121>	That means yes
Feb 10 15:53:27 <unix121>	nice
Feb 10 16:05:51 <smoke>	Dude
Feb 10 16:05:56 <smoke>	Noice, score
Feb 10 16:17:48 <smoke>	hahaha, it really didnt like that
Feb 10 16:33:31 <iDanoo>	.8ball yes or no?
Feb 10 16:33:31 *	Minimo shakes the magic 8 ball... My reply is no
Feb 10 16:37:05 <unix121>	aka yes ?
Feb 10 16:54:19 <dobbie>	fuck yeah, just made a nice html sgnature for my thunderbird for the new email address
Feb 10 16:56:23 <unix121>	mhmmmmm
Feb 10 17:00:09 <unix121>	smoke: I see that you hate using functions :P
Feb 10 17:00:40 <unix121>	i did a minor cleanup on al-hello but didn't push it, maybe you wanna take a look
Feb 10 17:00:48 <unix121>	https://github.com/unix121/Archlabs-Pipemenus/blob/master/stable/al-hello
Feb 10 17:01:34 <smoke>	I just dont see the point if its only ever meant to run once top to bottom
Feb 10 17:02:16 <unix121>	depends, I like code to be readable without having to actually look all of it :P
Feb 10 17:03:10 <smoke>	:D
Feb 10 17:04:07 <smoke>	I agree
Feb 10 17:04:19 <smoke>	trust me you dont wanna see what it was like before XD
Feb 10 17:04:43 <smoke>	But yea the files it sources are just a bunch of function
Feb 10 17:04:44 <unix121>	I can always go back a few merges and check :P
Feb 10 17:04:47 <dobbie>	Who's this Whisperofj guy at github?  He seems to be right in amongst it all
Feb 10 17:04:49 <smoke>	Yea
Feb 10 17:05:19 <unix121>	I've noticed him as well, he does a lot of code cleanup
Feb 10 17:05:35 <dobbie>	Yeah, its nice to see

Feb 11 09:08:21 <dobbie>	Gidday Stav
Feb 11 09:10:52 <unix121>	have you listened the Paysage d'Hiver's latest split?
Feb 11 09:11:12 <dobbie>	Not sure, I did see it.....no I haven't
Feb 11 09:11:36 <unix121>	Oh you should.
Feb 11 09:11:55 <unix121>	Listening to Paysage d'Hiver on descent quality made me feel unconfortable :P
Feb 11 09:12:02 <dobbie>	Let me see if I can find it
Feb 11 09:12:04 <unix121>	I was used that raw/grim sound they had xD
Feb 11 09:12:12 <unix121>	https://paysagedhiver.bandcamp.com/track/schnee-iii
Feb 11 09:12:25 <dobbie>	Cool, I have the right one then
Feb 11 09:12:50 <unix121>	It almost sound like it wasn't recorded on a Nokia 3310
Feb 11 09:13:03 <dobbie>	hahaha
Feb 11 09:13:27 <dobbie>	There is a split with Drudkh too
Feb 11 09:13:46 <unix121>	Drudkh have the funniest name ever
Feb 11 09:13:53 <dobbie>	Pretty amazing band
Feb 11 09:13:56 <unix121>	It literally means "wood" in Hungarian
Feb 11 09:14:10 <unix121>	Ukranian*
Feb 11 09:14:24 <unix121>	Yeah they are awesome :P I used to listen to them alot
Feb 11 09:14:28 <dobbie>	Yeah that is amusing
Feb 11 09:15:41 <unix121>	Europeans man. Only funny names everywhere
Feb 11 09:17:35 <dobbie>	I just realised Paysage d'Hiver has never actuallt released an album
Feb 11 09:18:20 <unix121>	Yeah, they are either leaked demos or splits
Feb 11 09:18:26 <unix121>	fkn europeans :P
Feb 11 09:18:38 <dobbie>	the Swiss.....crazy fuckers
Feb 11 09:19:25 <unix121>	I always confuse them with Sweden
Feb 11 09:19:48 <unix121>	Swiss have the least known music :P
Feb 11 09:20:10 <dobbie>	Yup other than Celtic Frost :D
Feb 11 09:20:16 <sqamsqam>	iDanoo: seet. might do that with my znc too. was getting real sick of random gaps
Feb 11 09:20:26 <sqamsqam>	iDanoo: nah havent played with matrix
Feb 11 09:20:35 <iDanoo>	hah yeah it's a bitch
Feb 11 09:20:49 <unix121>	I never really liked Celtic Frost :'(
Feb 11 09:21:23 <dobbie>	What?  Monotheist is prefection man
Feb 11 09:22:29 <unix121>	:') Tbh I don't generally like the first wave of black metal :P
Feb 11 09:22:37 <dobbie>	Not even Bathory?
Feb 11 09:22:43 <unix121>	It sounds too much like Thrash metal :P
Feb 11 09:22:49 <unix121>	Blood Fire Death
Feb 11 09:22:54 <unix121>	or whatever it's called is awesome
Feb 11 09:23:01 <unix121>	but it's the only one that I actually like :P
Feb 11 09:23:11 <dobbie>	Man...I must be showing my age :D  Bathory rules,I love all those early BM bands
Feb 11 09:23:42 <unix121>	Well I generally like American Black metal more than Early European
Feb 11 09:23:54 <unix121>	American BM sounds exceptionally good
Feb 11 09:24:15 <dobbie>	I prefer the European stuff to be honest.  Darkthrone, nothing in America compares.
Feb 11 09:25:14 <unix121>	Punkthrone are awesome. Although the music has remained the same, Fenriz is quite a personality
Feb 11 09:25:38 <unix121>	Norwegians are kinda crazy, Frost, Fenriz, Varg :P
Feb 11 09:25:54 <dobbie>	Man all Darkthrone is awesome.  I like lining up the whole disco, playing from start to finish and listen to how they have changed
Feb 11 09:26:43 <dobbie>	In fact I am going to do that right after Morid Angel has finished up
Feb 11 09:26:48 <unix121>	Transilvanian Hunger was the album that got me into Metal in general
Feb 11 09:26:57 <unix121>	I'm not the ordinary guy who got into metal from Metallica :P
Feb 11 09:27:21 <dobbie>	I have a cool Tranny Hungry hoody, the zip broke but I can't bring myself to throw it out
Feb 11 09:27:45 <unix121>	I'm attached to my merch as well :P
Feb 11 09:28:02 <unix121>	I wear the same Insomnium - Above the weeping world hoodie for over 10 years lol
Feb 11 09:28:09 <dobbie>	I'm down to about 6 Metallica tees from about 20-25
Feb 11 09:28:32 <unix121>	Oh I only like Ride the Lightning and Justice for all
Feb 11 09:28:38 <unix121>	the rest are typical thrash
Feb 11 09:28:46 <unix121>	and I fkn hate thrash metal
Feb 11 09:28:54 <unix121>	(except early Machine Head) xD
Feb 11 09:29:16 <dobbie>	I love Metallica, I never listen to them though, probably because I find it boring. But you always love your first metal band.
Feb 11 09:29:36 <dobbie>	Thrash has to be ultra good for me to really enjoy it, Vektor is a good example, Exodus too
Feb 11 09:29:47 <unix121>	I learned to play the guitar by playing only metallica songs :P
Feb 11 09:29:53 <unix121>	I have listed to many times to Fade to Black
Feb 11 09:30:01 <unix121>	that now I just can't listen to it anymore xD
Feb 11 09:30:05 <dobbie>	Nice, I am too uncoordinated to play guitar
Feb 11 09:30:36 <unix121>	Syncing your hands to play guitar is easy
Feb 11 09:30:44 <unix121>	Syncing everything to play drums is hard :P
Feb 11 09:30:55 <dobbie>	Not when you are me :D  Both my sons are very good drummers.
Feb 11 09:31:26 <unix121>	That's awesome and it sucks at the same time :P
Feb 11 09:31:30 <dobbie>	:)
Feb 11 09:31:35 <unix121>	Drums is awesome if you are the one who plays it :P
Feb 11 09:31:41 <dobbie>	Yup
Feb 11 09:31:52 <unix121>	My youngest brother is a drummer and I can't stay at home when he plays it
Feb 11 09:32:03 <dobbie>	I love listening to the boys play
Feb 11 09:32:32 <unix121>	but that's weird
Feb 11 09:32:34 <unix121>	both are drummers?
Feb 11 09:32:39 <dobbie>	Yup
Feb 11 09:32:47 <unix121>	usually borther tend to pick different instrument each
Feb 11 09:32:58 <dobbie>	Yeah for some reason both got into it
Feb 11 09:33:40 <unix121>	that's awesome man
Feb 11 09:33:47 <unix121>	drums is the best exercise for the body, no shit
Feb 11 09:33:56 <dobbie>	Yeah and double awesome as they are both so good at it
Feb 11 09:34:27 <unix121>	how old are they btw?

Feb 11 09:35:08 <iDanoo>	Heh

Feb 11 09:35:36 <dobbie>	We got my eldest a electronic kit.  That's the way to go when you don't want noise
Feb 11 09:35:38 <unix121>	that's awesome man
Feb 11 09:35:46 <iDanoo>	Oh yeah, that's awesome.
Feb 11 09:36:06 <unix121>	half the black metal records are recorded in electronic kits :P
Feb 11 09:36:10 <unix121>	if not drum machines :P

Feb 17 08:24:51 <unix121>	So basically he has 40 less CS classes than my Uni
Feb 17 08:25:00 <unix121>	and he gets a diploma with the same "rights"
Feb 17 08:25:24 <unix121>	5 years - 5 classes in CS - All Python
Feb 17 08:25:41 <unix121>	the TL;DR of the University in Athens
Feb 17 08:33:21 <unix121>	oh i forgot the most rediculous of all
Feb 17 08:33:35 <unix121>	they also have some rights of civil engineering
Feb 17 08:33:51 <unix121>	they can basically design up to a 3-flat building
Feb 17 08:34:09 <smokeking>	LOL
Feb 17 08:34:11 <smokeking>	LOL
Feb 17 08:34:11 <unix121>	hello-darkness-my-old-friend.gifv
Feb 17 08:34:20 <unix121>	don't you have the there @smoke ?
Feb 17 08:34:35 <smokeking>	whats this?
Feb 17 08:35:01 <unix121>	when I worked at construction on the main employers was basically a guy with no Civil Engineering diploma, but an Electrical Engineer diploma
Feb 17 08:35:37 <smokeking>	Ahh man theyre half retards here
Feb 17 08:36:02 <smokeking>	that or their paid/ buddies with the dev
Feb 17 08:36:02 <dobbie>	smoke: same install error, its got to be my laptop  https://scrot.moe/image/68HfC
Feb 17 08:36:07 <unix121>	they basically go to a uni with mediocre classes and 0 speciality and they have openings to 4 different work markets
Feb 17 08:36:46 <unix121>	it's wornings
Feb 17 08:36:48 <smokeking>	I'm confused
Feb 17 08:36:49 <unix121>	warning*
Feb 17 08:36:52 <smokeking>	Yea
Feb 17 08:37:01 <smokeking>	why is it even popping the error flag
Feb 17 08:37:08 <smokeking>	I see no error
Feb 17 08:37:15 <smokeking>	ahh
Feb 17 08:37:17 <smokeking>	LOLOLOL
Feb 17 08:37:25 <dobbie>	No idea and it is telling me the install is done
Feb 17 08:37:27 <smokeking>	'no error reported'
Feb 17 08:37:31 <dobbie>	LOL
Feb 17 08:37:40 <dobbie>	Its got to be my hardware
Feb 17 08:37:40 <smokeking>	Fuck me man
Feb 17 08:37:57 <smokeking>	Nah it's not
Feb 17 08:38:11 <dobbie>	okay cool. Is it a driver issue?
Feb 17 08:38:20 <smokeking>	and thats not even an error
Feb 17 08:38:28 <smokeking>	nope, its just nothing
Feb 17 08:38:31 <unix121>	@Nate , so there you have to be a licenced Civil Engineer to build a home right? (Like here)
Feb 17 08:38:41 <unix121>	just ignore it Matt
Feb 17 08:38:42 <smokeking>	ends where you are dude
Feb 17 08:38:49 <smokeking>	Canada is a bigass empty place
Feb 17 08:39:00 <smokeking>	Lots of places where they dont know, dont care
Feb 17 08:39:05 <dobbie>	I cant go any further with it once that message pops up
Feb 17 08:39:09 <smokeking>	Yea
Feb 17 08:39:12 <smokeking>	I know
Feb 17 08:39:15 <smokeking>	I'll fix it
Feb 17 08:39:19 <dobbie>	oh cool
Feb 17 08:39:21 <unix121>	Yeah, but if you want to build a home yourself, you have to pay a Civil Engineer to "design" it right?
Feb 17 08:39:33 <smokeking>	not neccesarily
Feb 17 08:39:38 <unix121>	lol woot
Feb 17 08:39:48 <smokeking>	I sure as hit wouldnt unless I was required by law
Feb 17 08:39:49 <unix121>	here you have to get one even if you want to build a garage or something
Feb 17 08:39:54 <smokeking>	yea
Feb 17 08:40:02 <smokeking>	Its like that in the major areas
Feb 17 08:40:05 <smokeking>	obv
Feb 17 08:40:18 <unix121>	i keep forgetting that you have different laws per state/area
Feb 17 08:40:19 <smokeking>	but yea lots of people just dont
Feb 17 08:40:24 <smokeking>	kinda
Feb 17 08:40:27 <smokeking>	not just that
Feb 17 08:40:29 <smokeking>	but man
Feb 17 08:40:42 <smokeking>	they cant tell you what to do if they cant regulate it
Feb 17 08:40:53 <smokeking>	like there is places here you could walk
Feb 17 08:40:55 <smokeking>	and die
Feb 17 08:41:00 <smokeking>	before seeing another human
Feb 17 08:41:08 <unix121>	lol woot
Feb 17 08:41:22 <unix121>	I've never thought how spread canada is
Feb 17 08:41:22 <smokeking>	just endless emptiness
Feb 17 08:41:25 <smokeking>	yea
Feb 17 08:41:33 <unix121>	it seems big country but in terms of population it's not
Feb 17 08:41:41 <smokeking>	like 80% of the country really inst policed in any way
Feb 17 08:42:01 <smokeking>	like 50% of the country has no people anywheer near it
Feb 17 08:42:02 <unix121>	that's why everyone comes there illegaly :P
Feb 17 08:42:07 <smokeking>	lol
Feb 17 08:42:22 <smokeking>	My dad had a warrant before I was born
Feb 17 08:42:25 <unix121>	Norway is kinda the same, 90% of the population there is in the south side of the country
Feb 17 08:42:30 <smokeking>	you just go into te bush
Feb 17 08:42:34 <smokeking>	Yea
Feb 17 08:42:43 <smokeking>	I legit just watched a vid about that
Feb 17 08:42:49 <unix121>	lol
Feb 17 08:42:54 <unix121>	warrant for what?
Feb 17 08:42:57 <unix121>	i'm confused :P
Feb 17 08:43:03 <smokeking>	arrest
Feb 17 08:43:05 <smokeking>	lol
Feb 17 08:43:18 <unix121>	hahaha lol
Feb 17 08:43:23 <unix121>	that's kinda the way it works here as well
Feb 17 08:43:35 <smokeking>	Yea
Feb 17 08:43:41 <unix121>	in 2009 I was with my mother in the car behind a huge truck here at Patras
Feb 17 08:43:46 <smokeking>	I imagine its like that everywhere
Feb 17 08:43:55 <unix121>	outside of the port the light turns red and the cars stop
Feb 17 08:43:59 <smokeking>	with varying degrees
Feb 17 08:44:07 <unix121>	and out of nowhere 10 people come out of the bushes
Feb 17 08:44:14 <smokeking>	Thats nut
Feb 17 08:44:16 <smokeking>	nuts
Feb 17 08:44:17 <unix121>	and start hanging from the truck to get out of the country
Feb 17 08:44:24 <smokeking>	Hahaha
Feb 17 08:44:26 <smokeking>	wtf
Feb 17 08:44:52 <unix121>	have you ever seen a guy fitting in the space between a truck's tire and the bot of the cargo?
Feb 17 08:44:54 <unix121>	cause I have
Feb 17 08:45:01 <unix121>	we have a huge problem with illegals here
Feb 17 08:45:16 <unix121>	basically every city near the sea has
Feb 17 08:45:31 <unix121>	it's easy to come illegaly using passenger boats here
Feb 17 08:46:28 <unix121>	me and a couple of friends went to Italy in the first years just like that
Feb 17 08:46:41 <unix121>	we literally walk into a boat (the ones that take cars and people)
Feb 17 08:46:42 <smokeking>	Hahaha
Feb 17 08:46:48 <smokeking>	thats funny
Feb 17 08:46:55 <unix121>	and in the morning we were in Italy
Feb 17 08:47:00 <unix121>	we spend the day there and then came back
Feb 17 08:47:09 <unix121>	no-one never asked us for tickets or ID
Feb 17 08:47:12 <smokeking>	Europe is crazy to me
Feb 17 08:47:26 <smokeking>	Thats awesome
Feb 17 08:47:38 <unix121>	it's too common here, people do it all the time
Feb 17 08:47:49 <unix121>	the port in my city is the main port if you want to get to italy
Feb 17 08:47:57 <unix121>	and if you can't get for free
Feb 17 08:48:16 <unix121>	you can pay literally any truck driver like 10$ to let you sit in the passenger sit with your friends
Feb 17 08:48:20 <unix121>	while they load up the truck
Feb 17 08:48:27 <unix121>	so that you don't have to pay a ticket
Feb 17 08:48:40 <unix121>	cause the price for truck+people is the same as just truck
Feb 17 08:48:52 <smokeking>	hahaha
Feb 17 08:48:58 <smokeking>	so its just free money
Feb 17 08:49:04 <unix121>	yeah man
Feb 17 08:49:07 <smokeking>	nice
Feb 17 08:49:11 <smokeking>	win win
Feb 17 08:49:15 <unix121>	it's kinda awesome that you can travel without any passport here
Feb 17 08:49:23 <smokeking>	Yea man
Feb 17 08:49:29 <unix121>	if you have ID you can get to any country in Europe
Feb 17 08:49:30 <smokeking>	I need a passport to go anywhere
Feb 17 08:49:41 <smokeking>	not within canada obv
Feb 17 08:49:46 <unix121>	Yeah I know, which is hard to get as well
Feb 17 08:49:48 <smokeking>	but yea, leaving the border
Feb 17 08:49:53 <smokeking>	yea man
Feb 17 08:50:13 <unix121>	borders are imaginary :P
Feb 17 08:50:19 <unix121>	you don't even have to jump the there :P
Feb 17 08:52:12 <smokeking>	LOL
Feb 17 08:52:42 <smokeking>	Can you imagine
Feb 17 08:52:50 <smokeking>	A wall spanning the US canada border
Feb 17 08:52:56 <smokeking>	Jesus
Feb 17 08:55:12 <unix121>	that's kinda how it's here
Feb 17 08:55:20 <unix121>	we have sea all around except the north
Feb 17 08:55:32 <unix121>	and as far as I know from friend that went to army
Feb 17 08:55:52 <unix121>	the borders are actual borders here on the north for the biggest part
Feb 17 08:56:03 <unix121>	not a wall , but that meta-spiky thing
Feb 17 08:56:15 <unix121>	on all the none-mountain areas
Feb 17 08:56:46 <smokeking>	we just have the fact that we dont wanna be in maerica holding us here
Feb 17 08:56:59 <smokeking>	:P
Feb 17 08:57:13 <unix121>	americans don't want to be in canada as far as i know as well
Feb 17 08:57:21 <unix121>	cause of the prices there :P
Feb 17 08:57:36 <smokeking>	I dont think thats quite how conversion works
Feb 17 08:57:44 <smokeking>	there money is worth a shitton here
Feb 17 08:57:51 <smokeking>	their*
Feb 17 08:58:22 <unix121>	murican money man
Feb 17 08:58:24 <smokeking>	thats how we feel
Feb 17 08:58:27 <smokeking>	go there
Feb 17 08:58:32 <smokeking>	get your money halved
Feb 17 08:59:13 <unix121>	oh i was expecting: go there, have your money halved, get shot, have your money stolen
Feb 17 08:59:18 <smokeking>	Oh thats weird
Feb 17 08:59:26 <smokeking>	I cant use uppercase
Feb 17 08:59:29 <smokeking>	d
Feb 17 08:59:41 <unix121>	THATS WEIRD
Feb 17 08:59:45 <smokeking>	Feelsbadman
Feb 17 08:59:50 <smokeking>	super
Feb 17 09:00:02 <unix121>	keyboard fucked?
Feb 17 09:00:18 <smokeking>	I was fuckin with stuff trying to get n's system figured
Feb 17 09:00:21 <smokeking>	Nah
Feb 17 09:00:28 <smokeking>	Just uppercase d
Feb 17 09:00:41 <smokeking>	Something to do with the terminal surely
Feb 17 09:00:58 <smokeking>	Just in weechat too
Feb 17 09:00:59 <unix121>	you might have a bind with shift+d
Feb 17 09:01:00 <smokeking>	LOL
Feb 17 09:01:12 <smokeking>	Yea perhaps
Feb 17 09:01:17 <smokeking>	No idea
Feb 17 09:01:31 <smokeking>	with all the random zsh shit I was loading it's very possible
Feb 17 09:01:57 <unix121>	believe it or not i started using zsh only like a year ago :P
Feb 17 09:03:40 <smokeking>	Hah
Feb 17 09:03:50 <smokeking>	Yea same
Feb 17 09:04:02 <smokeking>	I dunno bash was always fine for me learning
Feb 17 09:04:25 <smokeking>	I was never much of a terminal user before anyhow so it made zero difference to me
Feb 17 09:05:05 <smokeking>	Theres a few things about zsh I really like and notice when I dont have them
Feb 17 09:05:50 <smokeking>	case insensitive completion and incremental history search
Feb 17 09:06:25 <unix121>	i like the awesome customization that it offers :P
Feb 17 09:10:20 <smokeking>	Yea
Feb 17 09:22:21 <smokeking>	Ok I fixed all the scripts to follow symlinks
Feb 17 09:22:36 <unix121>	mhmmm nice man, nice
Feb 17 09:22:48 <unix121>	i gotta find out who to create popup windows with polybar
Feb 17 09:23:06 <unix121>	like a calendar pop-up when you click on the clock etc
Feb 17 09:23:09 <unix121>	I've never done them before :p
Feb 17 09:23:40 <smokeking>	You wanna map actions to the default modules?
Feb 17 09:24:21 <smokeking>	The only way I've found so far is to wrap the label in an action or more
Feb 17 09:25:03 <unix121>	i suspect that that's the only way to do it with polybar anyways :P
Feb 17 09:25:09 <unix121>	so I guess I'll try that :P
Feb 17 09:25:52 <smokeking>	Well if you use the script module or any custom module
Feb 17 09:26:01 <smokeking>	there is actual settings for clicks
Feb 17 09:26:09 <smokeking>	but the default modules there arent
Feb 17 09:26:29 <smokeking>	so the only way around it is with the ability to wrap labels with commands
Feb 17 09:27:30 <smokeking>	https://github.com/jaagr/polybar/wiki/Formatting
Feb 17 09:27:44 <smokeking>	The formatting wiki page explains much better
Feb 17 09:28:00 <smokeking>	%{A1:command:} clickable text %{A}
Feb 17 09:28:06 <smokeking>	pretty simple
Feb 17 09:28:17 <smokeking>	you can use A1-3
Feb 17 09:28:35 <smokeking>	for mouse left, middle and right
Feb 17 09:29:04 <smokeking>	Some modules cat use certain mouse actions though
Feb 17 09:29:16 <smokeking>	eg. volume right click mutes
Feb 17 09:29:24 <smokeking>	or whaever
Feb 17 09:32:31 <unix121>	oh nice, I'm gonna get right into it
Feb 17 09:33:08 <smokeking>	Main reason I do it is that the built in modules are much more efficient than scripts
Feb 17 09:34:47 <unix121>	indeed :P
Feb 17 09:36:24 <smokeking>	I wanted to do some kind of window buttons for open applications
Feb 17 09:36:33 <smokeking>	But it gets messy quick
Feb 17 09:40:32 <unix121>	you mean like a menu that comes from polybar?
Feb 17 09:44:53 <smokeking>	nah
Feb 17 09:45:04 <smokeking>	like a bunch of general font glyphs
Feb 17 09:46:05 <unix121>	oh i get you
Feb 17 09:46:06 <smokeking>	Like your average panel but it would all be done through text
Feb 17 09:46:09 <smokeking>	yea
Feb 17 09:46:33 <unix121>	mhmm
Feb 17 09:46:44 <smokeking>	totally easy for one WM and a few select apps
Feb 17 09:47:08 <smokeking>	but if you get into it soon the realization of how much BS there is to deal with
Feb 17 09:47:17 <smokeking>	just not worth it
Feb 17 09:55:33 <unix121>	yeap :P I dunno :P I like simple things :P
Feb 17 09:56:30 <smokeking>	yo that

Feb 17 10:56:40 <unix121>	Hello Mr. Daniel
Feb 17 10:58:19 <iDanoo>	Soooo I couldn't get 2018.02 working
Feb 17 10:58:22 <iDanoo>	installed 2017.12
Feb 17 10:58:28 <dobbie>	I couldn't either :D
Feb 17 10:58:30 <dobbie>	:(
Feb 17 10:58:41 <iDanoo>	Looked like it wasn't copying the UEFI stuff over
Feb 17 10:59:09 <iDanoo>	It added an entry but just wouldn't boot
Feb 17 10:59:33 <avnsgt[m]>	I need a confirmation on a al-hello script bug.. it seems when you opt to install additional software, and select chrome for your browser, the script completes and only installs chrome.
Feb 17 10:59:39 <iDanoo>	i fixed that yesterday
Feb 17 10:59:41 <iDanoo>	fix got merged in

Feb 17 11:12:30 <avnsgt[m]>	iDanoo: I like confirmation or reproducible results
Feb 17 11:13:17 <iDanoo>	Yeah, I changed that var, tested and it worked, took it out and it failed again

Feb 17 13:06:24 <iDanoo>	We can give it a go lol
Feb 17 13:07:24 <avnsgt[m]>	To bridge the room in there are some bits of info needed,  or one must have chanops.

Feb 17 13:09:43 <avnsgt[m]>	It needs a key for the channel..
Feb 17 13:09:58 <iDanoo>	huh
Feb 17 13:09:59 <iDanoo>	a key lol
Feb 17 13:10:23 <avnsgt[m]>	Yeah.. You get it from the ChanServ. But you need Ops to get the key.
Feb 17 13:11:13 <iDanoo>	2 sec
Feb 17 13:11:48 <iDanoo>	Uhhh you should only need a key for invite only rooms
Feb 17 13:11:51 <iDanoo>	"Channel mode +/- k allows you to set or remove a secret key for a channel. Channels that have a key set cannot be joined without giving the key, unless the user is invited in. Users trying to join a channel that has a key set, without giving a key will receive following error message: "#SwiftChannel unable to join channel (need correct key)". Only halfops and above can set and remove this mode."
Feb 17 13:11:56 <iDanoo>	Channel isn't set to +k
Feb 17 13:13:23 <iDanoo>	Can't assign it flags cause MatrixBridge isn't registered lol
Feb 17 13:13:56 <avnsgt[m]>	Hmm.. Then only the OP or IRC owner can bridge, maybe?
Feb 17 13:14:16 <iDanoo>	Maybe.. How're you doing it?
Feb 17 13:14:28 <avnsgt[m]>	I need to take closer look at some docs here.
Feb 17 13:14:58 <avnsgt[m]>	You create a Riot Channel, and make it public, then add the IRC bridge.

Feb 17 13:15:31 *	iDanoo gives voice to sqamsqam
Feb 17 13:15:40 <avnsgt[m]>	I have a list of names in the Chanpick that can accept the bridge.
Feb 17 13:15:42 <iDanoo>	.g bridge riot and irc rooms
Feb 17 13:15:44 <Minimo>	(iDanoo) https://opensource.com/article/17/5/introducing-riot-IRC -- IRC for the 21st Century: Introducing Riot | Opensource.com: "May 19, 2017 ... Matrix was built to integrate with IRC servers and other communication protocols, meaning you can use the Riot client as an IRC..."

Feb 17 13:16:32 <iDanoo>	That seems like it's just for the bridge though
Feb 17 13:16:34 <iDanoo>	not to merge rooms
Feb 17 13:16:38 <iDanoo>	OH
Feb 17 13:16:41 <iDanoo>	is that what you're trying to go?
Feb 17 13:16:44 <iDanoo>	Just get the bridge up?
Feb 17 13:17:40 <avnsgt[m]>	In a sense it merges the 2, in that the 2 share one space.
Feb 17 13:20:40 <iDanoo>	Wow these docs aren't clear
Feb 17 13:20:46 <iDanoo>	Googling brings up heaps of alternate methods
Feb 17 13:20:56 <avnsgt[m]>	channop nicks that can accept the bridge are: iDanno, dobbie, Minimo, and ChanServ
Feb 17 13:21:33 <avnsgt[m]>	What do these names all have in common?
Feb 17 13:28:32 <avnsgt[m]>	I wonder if me being in the irc room is the issue.. maybe I need to leave before the bridge can enter.

Feb 17 13:49:47 <iDanoo>	<MatrixBridge> @avnsgt:matrix.org has requested to bridge 'archlabslinux' (https://matrix.to/#/!UxaLxVrgMFiXWUiHkc:matrix.org) with #archlabslinux on this IRC network. Respond with 'yes' or 'y' to allow, or simply ignore this message to disallow. You have 300 seconds from when this message was sent.
Feb 17 13:50:33 <avnsgt[m]>	I added you and clicked multiple times
Feb 17 13:50:35 <iDanoo>	hahahahahaha
Feb 17 13:51:17 <avnsgt[m]>	You have to respond to the bridge request now
Feb 17 13:51:34 <avnsgt[m]>	On the link in the channel.
Feb 17 13:52:42 <avnsgt[m]>	yes
Feb 17 13:55:41 <iDanoo>	I did :)
Feb 17 13:56:16 <avnsgt[m]>	Now, I wonder why the rest of the irc channel doesn't appear yet?
Feb 17 13:56:31 <avnsgt[m]>	Maybe it will take some time to update as everyone becomes active.

Feb 17 13:57:32 <iDanoo>	I think as people say stuff it'll populate
Feb 17 13:58:13 <avnsgt[m]>	You can't see it on your end, but our RIot channel looks like the IRC, but with a little more funcitionality and our logo on it.
Feb 17 13:58:20 <iDanoo>	I just joined as test2wqdd[m]
