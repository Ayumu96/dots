Feb 06 12:20:26 <dobbie>	cheers Stav
Feb 06 12:20:37 <unix121>	you should register your account on free node
Feb 06 12:20:55 <unix121>	"/msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com"
Feb 06 12:21:09 <dobbie>	can i do this in this room?
Feb 06 12:21:11 <unix121>	where "password" is your password and email is your mail obviously
Feb 06 12:21:27 <unix121>	mhm just click on freenode if you are on Hexchat and do it from there
Feb 06 12:21:41 <unix121>	but it should work from here as well
Feb 06 12:22:01 <iDanoo>	yeah definitely
Feb 06 12:22:09 <iDanoo>	msg is a global command, will be sweet
Feb 06 12:22:32 <dobbie>	all done, I was alrady registered/

Feb 06 12:22:55 <unix121>	the rest should join here as well
Feb 06 12:22:57 <dobbie>	now stupid question, will I automatically login when I start hexchat?
Feb 06 12:23:06 <unix121>	it's annoying that you can't pin a post on Hangouts to let everyone know
Feb 06 12:23:19 <unix121>	depends on how you set it
Feb 06 12:23:26 <iDanoo>	You might need to /msg nickserv identify <pass>

Feb 06 12:26:00 <iDanoo>	Awesome
Feb 06 12:26:04 *	iDanoo gives voice to unix121
Feb 06 12:26:32 <unix121>	I think you should add it on the AL website, that there is now a general AL irc channel
Feb 06 12:27:00 <dobbie>	Doing that now...
Feb 06 12:27:32 <unix121>	great. It's also possible to add an IRC client on the ISO that auto connects to the channel for live assistance with installation etc
Feb 06 12:27:51 <unix121>	most distros do it cause it's easy way to get live assitance
Feb 06 12:28:14 <dobbie>	We need Nate here for this....Nate? Nate?

Feb 06 12:29:44 <dobbie>	Who is matrixbridge?
Feb 06 12:30:15 <unix121>	That's actually easy, you add the dinary of the chat on the live ISO and you add the channel you want to auto enter on the config file.
Feb 06 12:30:22 <iDanoo>	  I'll be back in 10
Feb 06 12:30:22 <unix121>	It's basically a 5 minute job :P

Feb 06 12:31:02 <unix121>	@dobbie there are some bots in IRC
Feb 06 12:31:06 <dobbie>	Larry wants to know if we have bridging available? How do we enable it?
Feb 06 12:31:47 <unix121>	Bridging, meaning?
Feb 06 12:31:59 <dobbie>	No idea.....

Feb 06 13:03:55 <unix121>	Hello sir
Feb 06 13:04:28 <avnsgt[m]>	g2g with Riot connections.
Feb 06 13:05:49 <unix121>	One step closer to completely removing Google from my life lol
Feb 06 13:06:37 <avnsgt[m]>	awesome
Feb 06 13:07:26 <avnsgt[m]>	Good old reliable IRC. Never fails.
Feb 06 13:07:46 <unix121>	Yeap, IRC and XMPP are awesome
Feb 06 13:07:50 <smoke>	haha, my first time ever touching IRC
Feb 06 13:09:28 <iDanoo>	It's amazing
Feb 06 13:09:34 <unix121>	you're gonna love it
Feb 06 13:09:38 <avnsgt[m]>	One of the best tools ever created.
Feb 06 13:10:53 <unix121>	hangouts used to slow my browser a lot
Feb 06 13:11:04 <unix121>	hexchat is so lightweight
Feb 06 13:11:20 <iDanoo>	If you're into CLI shoudl checkout weechat
Feb 06 13:11:48 <iDanoo>	https://imgur.com/a/4bhE8
Feb 06 13:12:15 <avnsgt[m]>	Btw, I just read about the adoption of the system wide freenode bot, by freenode. So, that makes it much easier. No more manual configuring the bot bridging. :)
Feb 06 13:12:21 <iDanoo>	Ah that's awesome
Feb 06 13:12:59 <avnsgt[m]>	Love weechat.
Feb 06 13:14:21 <unix121>	I'm gonna try it right away
Feb 06 13:14:56 <avnsgt[m]>	It is great, and highly customizable. So, take some time with it.
Feb 06 13:15:12 <avnsgt[m]>	Esp if you like to work with tmux or screen.
Feb 06 13:16:12 <unix121>	tmux is my favorite part of linux :P
Feb 06 13:19:04 <unix121>	wow weechat has a huge amount of features lol
Feb 06 13:19:05 <unix121>	nice
Feb 06 13:19:21 <avnsgt[m]>	Yep.
Feb 06 13:20:07 <avnsgt[m]>	And, a buddy of mine kind of got me started on Riot. I think the two of them together are sweet.
Feb 06 13:20:46 <avnsgt[m]>	Riot when in the GUI, and weechat in the CLI. ðŸ˜†
Feb 06 13:21:03 <iDanoo>	might need to try it out
Feb 06 13:22:54 <unix121>	I'm still trying to figure out weechat :P
Feb 06 13:28:39 <smoke>	same
Feb 06 13:28:58 <smoke>	fucking lost XD
Feb 06 13:29:38 <iDanoo>	Haha it takes a bit
Feb 06 13:29:54 <iDanoo>	but you can just setup a connection like /server add freenode irc.freenode.net/6697 -ssl -autoconnect
Feb 06 13:29:57 <iDanoo>	then /connect freenode
Feb 06 13:30:10 <iDanoo>	there's heeeaps of cool things
Feb 06 13:30:28 <unix121>	my basic problem is that when I connect to freenode it auto-changes my nickname to unix121_
Feb 06 13:30:30 <unix121>	:P
Feb 06 13:30:58 <smoke>	you can set the list of default nicknames it uses
Feb 06 13:31:06 <smoke>	I figured that out
Feb 06 13:31:16 <iDanoo>	yeah theres heaps of stuff you can do
Feb 06 13:31:19 <smoke>	but cant figure out scrolling the bloody screen :P
Feb 06 13:31:29 <unix121>	I've already done that, but as soon as I connect to freenode it changes it to the second one :P
Feb 06 13:31:48 <unix121>	pageup and down work just fine :P
Feb 06 13:32:03 <smoke>	oh god, thatnk you
Feb 06 13:33:42 <avnsgt[m]>	Imagine working on a Macbook without the pg up and down keys. Having to learn Macbook shortcuts for them. That was annoying.

Feb 06 13:38:06 <unix121>	The thing is that althought I've configured my freenode username to be unix121 , when I /connect freenode it auto changes it to unix121_ :P
Feb 06 13:38:20 <unix121>	so I cannot enter my password for unix121 :P
Feb 06 13:38:40 <unix121>	oh wait i might have found a solution

Feb 06 13:42:14 <avnsgt[m]>	Now. I have to remember all the special commands for IRC.
Feb 06 13:42:41 <unix121>	Tab swapping on weechat is awesome :P I like navigating with commands
Feb 06 13:42:48 *	avnsgt[m] slaps dobbie with a wet seabass.
Feb 06 13:42:58 <iDanoo>	alt + a goes to next active tab
Feb 06 13:43:24 <unix121>	I already have alt assigned to switch workspaces
Feb 06 13:43:32 <unix121>	so I set it other keybind
Feb 06 13:43:48 <unix121>	Weechat : 158 MB used. Beat that skype lol

Feb 06 13:45:58 <avnsgt[m]>	Not sure too many programs can... iriss.
Feb 06 13:46:41 <iDanoo>	irssi?
Feb 06 13:46:52 <avnsgt[m]>	Think I spelled that wrong.
Feb 06 13:46:52 <iDanoo>	158mb is still a bit
Feb 06 13:46:53 <avnsgt[m]>	lol
Feb 06 13:47:02 <avnsgt[m]>	irssi
Feb 06 13:47:04 <iDanoo>	oh 195mb here :\
Feb 06 13:47:31 <smoke>	yea
Feb 06 13:47:36 <smoke>	wass gonna say
Feb 06 13:47:49 <smoke>	150megs kinda seems excessive
Feb 06 13:48:00 <smoke>	tis the future
Feb 06 13:48:21 <smoke>	where a simple text chat application can consume gigabyes of memory
Feb 06 13:48:25 <smoke>	:P
Feb 06 13:48:45 <iDanoo>	I wonder what's actually using that much memory haha
Feb 06 13:48:47 <iDanoo>	Probably chat buffers
Feb 06 13:49:53 <smoke>	yea
Feb 06 13:49:58 <smoke>	lol
Feb 06 13:50:05 <smoke>	0.2% of memory
Feb 06 13:50:15 <smoke>	'seems excessive'
Feb 06 13:51:05 <smoke>	mines using around 32MB
Feb 06 13:51:15 <unix121>	ncmpcpp uses more memory than weechat :P
Feb 06 13:51:16 <smoke>	0.2% of 16G
Feb 06 13:51:38 <smoke>	You must have a literal shit ton of buffers my dude
Feb 06 13:51:43 <smoke>	:P
Feb 06 13:51:48 <avnsgt[m]>	That is a drop in the bucket.
Feb 06 13:51:53 <smoke>	yea

Feb 06 13:53:32 <iDanoo>	I used to use it with spotify for awhile
Feb 06 13:53:43 <unix121>	ok now it uses ~70 mb
Feb 06 13:53:59 <avnsgt[m]>	Kind of disappointed that Geekshed.net has not jump on to Riot, by adding a bot too.
Feb 06 13:54:02 <smoke>	yea, thats more like it
Feb 06 13:54:12 <unix121>	I only use ncmpcpp for music for the past year+ , it's the most lightweight thing ever
Feb 06 13:55:32 <unix121>	So, I'm gonna order 2x custom keycaps for my mech from maxkeyboards to replace the windows key
Feb 06 13:55:54 <unix121>	I'm either gonna go with the Linux Tux or the AL Logo cause it's fucking cool lol
Feb 06 13:56:46 <avnsgt[m]>	Really, where are ordering those from? I want to get rid of these hideous windows superkeys.
Feb 06 13:56:47 <avnsgt[m]>	lol
Feb 06 13:57:29 <unix121>	maxkeyboards man
Feb 06 13:57:45 <unix121>	they give you the option to order either full custom keycap set or like as many keys as you like
Feb 06 13:57:55 <avnsgt[m]>	Yeah.. I just seen that.
Feb 06 13:57:58 <unix121>	I'll just replace the windows key because I kate the logo
Feb 06 13:58:01 <unix121>	hate*
Feb 06 13:58:04 <avnsgt[m]>	Feel dumb. lol
Feb 06 13:58:20 <unix121>	I'm looking for the white/silver AL logo svg on the repos but I can't find it
Feb 06 13:58:30 <unix121>	to put this on the keycap
Feb 06 13:59:33 <avnsgt[m]>	Well, I have cut into my fun time.. Time for some Bloodborne..
Feb 06 13:59:37 <avnsgt[m]>	have fun.
Feb 06 14:00:17 <unix121>	have fun mate
Feb 06 14:01:05 <ofperfection>	AL logo keys would be neat.
Feb 06 14:01:42 <ofperfection>	I've been waffling on what I want on a key, leaning towards getting a set of Vim arrow/letter keycaps
Feb 06 14:01:45 <unix121>	The silver one is gonna look great with the white backlight on my keyboad
Feb 06 14:02:08 <unix121>	There was a drop on massdrop a while ago with VIM related keycaps
Feb 06 14:02:19 <unix121>	I was so sad that I didn' thave the money to join that drop
Feb 06 14:02:40 <unix121>	Greek capital controls have fucked me over
Feb 06 14:02:54 <ofperfection>	I don't think I know what that is
Feb 06 14:03:18 <unix121>	Because as known Greece is a corrupted country and now we are forced to pay money to Germans
Feb 06 14:03:25 <unix121>	there are some capital controls in effect till August
Feb 06 14:03:43 <unix121>	like , you can't withdrawl over 340euros / day from ATM
Feb 06 14:03:49 <ofperfection>	Oooh
Feb 06 14:04:11 <unix121>	and you can't buy from international shops using your Visa etc
Feb 06 14:04:13 <ofperfection>	Thought you were talking about capital letters and the ctrl key
Feb 06 14:04:17 <unix121>	unless the bank approves the sale
Feb 06 14:04:19 <ofperfection>	Geez
Feb 06 14:04:24 <unix121>	and don't approve anything
Feb 06 14:04:39 <unix121>	I wanted to sell my Dash when Dash reached 1600 euros
Feb 06 14:04:47 <unix121>	and I couldn't because of the capital control
Feb 06 14:04:50 <ofperfection>	I'll have to look into those specifics
Feb 06 14:05:07 <unix121>	yeah man, it's fucking stupid :/
Feb 06 14:05:20 <unix121>	At least it's over in August :P It's already been 2 years that they are in effect
Feb 06 14:09:14 <ofperfection>	Hopefully they find a solution with their creditors out there
Feb 06 14:09:36 <iDanoo>	oh wow
Feb 06 14:10:18 <unix121>	They'll never do it.
Feb 06 14:10:42 <unix121>	Greece has sold the national TV , the national telecommunication (OTE) to Germany
Feb 06 14:10:58 <unix121>	and now it's about to sell the National Power Provider to repay
Feb 06 14:11:14 <ofperfection>	Is that better than austerity
Feb 06 14:11:27 <unix121>	Which means that basically 3 of the basic utilities that everyone has will be payed to German companies instead of Greek
Feb 06 14:11:44 <iDanoo>	Wow
Feb 06 14:11:48 <iDanoo>	I had no idea it was that bad.
Feb 06 14:11:52 <unix121>	So basically Greece will never revover the financial hole that the previous politicians dug
Feb 06 14:12:20 <unix121>	Yeah man, Greek Politicians + Orthodox Church destroyed the country
Feb 06 14:15:02 <iDanoo>	 Anyway
Feb 06 14:15:04 <iDanoo>	I'll be back later
Feb 06 14:15:07 <iDanoo>	gotta get some work done haha

Feb 06 14:55:59 <ofperfection>	Yo
Feb 06 14:56:11 <unix121>	Oh by the way, who are you ofperf?
Feb 06 14:56:36 <ofperfection>	In what context
Feb 06 14:57:00 <dobbie>	ofperf = Shaun
Feb 06 14:57:10 <dobbie>	he's helping with the webpage alongside Dan and Sam
Feb 06 14:57:12 <unix121>	Oh ok, cause I know everyone by name and not nickname :P
Feb 06 14:58:00 <dobbie>	:)
Feb 06 14:58:32 <dobbie>	oh man, still no Linux update for Larry
Feb 06 14:59:44 <unix121>	I added a pinned post on the subreddit to push people to join #archlabslinux for general questions and assistance
Feb 06 15:01:36 <dobbie>	Good stuff, I added one at G+ :)

Feb 06 15:06:12 <ofperfection>	I'm Sean!
Feb 06 15:06:33 <dobbie>	Oh Shit, I meant Sean not Shaun....sorry man!
Feb 06 15:06:50 <ofperfection>	all good
Feb 06 15:07:00 <unix121>	I guess that they both sound the same :P
Feb 06 15:07:07 <ofperfection>	Yes they do
Feb 06 15:07:25 <unix121>	When are you from ? I see you timed out cause of high ping (276)
Feb 06 15:07:35 <ofperfection>	WA state
Feb 06 15:07:45 <ofperfection>	I was on mobile, and when I got back to the house my phone grabbed the wifi and it took a shit
Feb 06 15:07:50 <ofperfection>	(USA)
Feb 06 15:08:31 <unix121>	Oh from Amurica!
Feb 06 15:08:36 <ofperfection>	M U R C A
Feb 06 15:09:44 <unix121>	I know a guy from MURCA who lives very close to the Canada borders, next to a forrest full of wasps
Feb 06 15:09:49 <unix121>	America must suck lol
Feb 06 15:10:02 <ofperfection>	I was born in Texas
Feb 06 15:10:11 <ofperfection>	the wasp biodiversity there is fuckin incredible
Feb 06 15:10:20 <ofperfection>	these canadian border wasps ain't shit
Feb 06 15:11:09 <unix121>	He was half American half Greek, so he was in Greece for Summer, missing for like 2 months from america
Feb 06 15:11:22 <unix121>	and he comes back to USA, and the wasps had raided his home
Feb 06 15:11:35 <ofperfection>	lol
Feb 06 15:11:42 <unix121>	he sent a pic which a huge wasp nest inside their living room
Feb 06 15:13:03 <unix121>	I'm basically terrified of everything that qualifies as an insect and has wings
Feb 06 15:18:57 <ofperfection>	I ain't gonna lie
Feb 06 15:19:04 <ofperfection>	you gotta stay on top of the wasp nests out here
Feb 06 15:19:18 <ofperfection>	never had a nest inside tho
Feb 06 15:19:51 <unix121>	Man if I ever found a wasp next on my home, first thing I'd do would be to burn my home.
Feb 06 15:19:58 <ofperfection>	geez
Feb 06 15:20:06 <ofperfection>	I just load up on wasp spray
Feb 06 15:20:15 <unix121>	Have you read that TIFU of the guy who ignored a weird sound on his roof ?
Feb 06 15:20:24 <ofperfection>	I don't think so
Feb 06 15:20:34 <unix121>	The TL;DR version is this:
Feb 06 15:20:58 <unix121>	Guy ignores for months a weird sound on his roof
Feb 06 15:21:11 <unix121>	One day comes back home and finds his place FULL of wasps
Feb 06 15:21:32 <unix121>	The sound that he ignored was Wasps building a huge nest inside his roof
Feb 06 15:21:50 <ofperfection>	I have a tennis racquet with a nine volt in it
Feb 06 15:22:00 <unix121>	and the nest got so huge that the roof couldn't hold it, so it fell down, throught the ceiling into the living room and broke
Feb 06 15:22:04 <ofperfection>	I used to sit on my porch swing and swat the wasps out of the sky
Feb 06 15:22:23 <unix121>	I always wanted to do that :P I've only done it with flies
Feb 06 15:22:34 <ofperfection>	yeah it's nice because wasps are much easier to hit
Feb 06 15:22:41 <unix121>	and the other flies that have the light on them :P ( don't know the english word for them )
Feb 06 15:22:47 <ofperfection>	fireflies
Feb 06 15:22:50 <unix121>	Oh yeah
Feb 06 15:23:13 <unix121>	but I hoped that hitting them with it, it would make their light stronger before they die :P
Feb 06 15:23:16 <unix121>	but it didn't xD
Feb 06 15:23:19 <unix121>	I was a kid :P
Feb 06 15:23:44 <ofperfection>	lol
Feb 06 15:24:04 <ofperfection>	in the NW of WA here the bugs aren't too bad
Feb 06 15:24:14 <ofperfection>	in Texas though, they were
Feb 06 15:24:16 <ofperfection>	fire ants
Feb 06 15:24:26 <ofperfection>	4 colors of wasp
Feb 06 15:24:30 <ofperfection>	snakes
Feb 06 15:24:34 <unix121>	Those are the ones that can kill you? (fire ants)
Feb 06 15:24:43 <ofperfection>	I mean it's technically possible
Feb 06 15:24:45 <unix121>	Oh no, those are the Army Ants
Feb 06 15:24:54 <ofperfection>	but usually that'd be an allergy thing
Feb 06 15:25:30 <ofperfection>	fire ants are aggressive and will swarm you before all biting simultaneously
Feb 06 15:25:57 <unix121>	lol wtf
Feb 06 15:26:02 <unix121>	bees do that as well
Feb 06 15:26:16 <unix121>	they kill other insects by swarming them and killing htem with the heat they create
Feb 06 15:29:26 <ofperfection>	idk tho I got nothing on the aussies
Feb 06 15:29:26 <ofperfection>	funnel webs and sea wasps and blue ring octopi and shit
Feb 06 15:30:23 <unix121>	OH JEEZ
Feb 06 15:30:29 <unix121>	I googled "funnel web"
Feb 06 15:30:34 <unix121>	why the fuck did I do that?
Feb 06 15:31:04 <unix121>	Man I'm glad I live in Greece , we don't have that kind of misscreations here
Feb 06 15:31:20 <dobbie>	Nothing like that in NZ either
Feb 06 15:31:22 <ofperfection>	yeah dude Australia is a known center of real fucked up nature
Feb 06 15:31:54 <dobbie>	Yup
Feb 06 15:32:12 <ofperfection>	Texas is about as bad as it gets in the US that I can think of
Feb 06 15:32:16 <unix121>	We have plenty of scorpions here tho
Feb 06 15:32:22 <ofperfection>	but I'd still take the wildlife there over AUS
Feb 06 15:33:25 <unix121>	The thing is that spiders are literally fearless
Feb 06 15:33:40 <ofperfection>	really depends on the spider
Feb 06 15:33:45 <ofperfection>	Like we've got black widows here
Feb 06 15:33:51 <ofperfection>	but they will do everything in their power to stay away from you
Feb 06 15:33:52 <unix121>	THE FUCK
Feb 06 15:34:03 <ofperfection>	Yeah they used to spook me, but at my first data center
Feb 06 15:34:09 <ofperfection>	the area was assigned they were EVERY
Feb 06 15:34:11 <ofperfection>	FUCKING
Feb 06 15:34:13 <ofperfection>	WHERE
Feb 06 15:34:15 <ofperfection>	so i got used to them
Feb 06 15:34:28 <unix121>	I guess it was because of the heat
Feb 06 15:34:36 <ofperfection>	yeah they used swamp coolers there
Feb 06 15:34:42 <ofperfection>	so during the winter they drained the coolers
Feb 06 15:34:42 <unix121>	The love the heat, so data center would be awesome for them
Feb 06 15:34:49 <ofperfection>	and spiders would set up shop in the nice, warm pods
Feb 06 15:35:00 <ofperfection>	and they were outdoor individual little pod enclosures
Feb 06 15:37:04 <unix121>	Worst I've ever come close to was a black scorpion in my garage
Feb 06 15:37:17 <unix121>	I've never seen an actual big spider
Feb 06 15:37:33 <unix121>	I bet we don't even have them here :P big hairy spiders ;P
Feb 06 15:38:02 <ofperfection>	Yeah you'll occasionally see big ones here, but really you'll only see giant nasty ones in the south
Feb 06 15:38:12 <ofperfection>	tarantulas, wind scorpions, etc.
Feb 06 15:38:14 <ofperfection>	vinegaroons
Feb 06 15:38:54 <unix121>	I'll never move into a warm place man.
Feb 06 15:39:13 <unix121>	I'll move to Norway or something. Have my head clean.
Feb 06 15:39:42 <ofperfection>	I don't really know where would be my ideal place to live
Feb 06 15:39:50 <ofperfection>	I really like Singapore
Feb 06 15:40:11 <ofperfection>	I like hawaii, but I ain't rich
Feb 06 15:40:35 <unix121>	Singapore has a warm climate right? based on the location
Feb 06 15:40:40 <ofperfection>	yes
Feb 06 15:40:43 <ofperfection>	year round tropical
Feb 06 15:40:49 <ofperfection>	they spray for bugs aggressively
Feb 06 15:40:55 <ofperfection>	I barely saw any bugs when I was there
Feb 06 15:41:01 <unix121>	I prefer cold ones. Norway-Finland-Sweden
Feb 06 15:41:02 <ofperfection>	which is impressive given that the climate is perfect for bugs
Feb 06 15:41:15 <ofperfection>	I've never gotten to visit Europe :(
Feb 06 15:41:26 <unix121>	Europe is nice :P
Feb 06 15:41:48 <unix121>	Spraying for bugs is easy, you can keep them away, what you can't keep away is other actual animals they go there
Feb 06 15:42:12 <unix121>	In my hometown we used to have a snake problem when I was a kid
Feb 06 15:42:43 <unix121>	which only went away when the city expanded closer to my area so there was no big field or place for them to live around anymore

Feb 07 19:49:55 <iDanoo>	I basically clone from http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/archlinux/
Feb 07 19:50:01 <iDanoo>	AU tier 1 mirror
Feb 07 19:50:19 <iDanoo>	that's everything without staging/testing
Feb 07 19:50:24 <smoke>	yea
Feb 07 19:50:28 <iDanoo>	I tried testing once
Feb 07 19:50:29 <iDanoo>	once.
Feb 07 19:50:34 <smoke>	I dont know who actuallly uses testing
Feb 07 19:50:42 <iDanoo>	Last time I had so many issues
Feb 07 19:50:42 <smoke>	it seems so pointless on arch
Feb 07 19:50:45 <smoke>	yea
Feb 07 19:50:51 <iDanoo>	randomly couldn't boot cause lvm2 was broken with dm-crypt
Feb 07 19:50:53 <dobbie>	I haven't used Testing since starting AL
Feb 07 19:50:53 <iDanoo>	haha
Feb 07 19:51:00 <smoke>	I tried once and also had a shit ton of issues
Feb 07 19:51:04 <iDanoo>	Yep
Feb 07 19:51:13 <iDanoo>	staging is better, but still too buggy
Feb 07 19:51:21 <iDanoo>	arch is pretty damn stable on the normal repos
Feb 07 19:51:23 <iDanoo>	i like it
Feb 07 19:51:28 <smoke>	yea
Feb 07 19:51:32 <smoke>	agree totally
Feb 07 19:51:53 <smoke>	plus normal repos on arch are so far ahead of most distro's anyhow
Feb 07 19:52:14 <iDanoo>	hell yeah
Feb 07 19:52:25 <iDanoo>	My server is on debian stable...
Feb 07 19:52:30 <iDanoo>	but hey at least it's damn stable
Feb 07 19:52:32 <iDanoo>	hahah
Feb 07 19:52:36 <smoke>	you go to ubuntu or debian and the packages are sooo bloody old
Feb 07 19:53:00 <iDanoo>	yep
Feb 07 19:53:12 <smoke>	I wanted to set my mom up with something fairly stable
Feb 07 19:53:18 <smoke>	thought I'd try ubuntu
Feb 07 19:53:23 <smoke>	Good god
Feb 07 19:53:40 <smoke>	was such a bitch to get a recent version of kodi working
Feb 07 19:53:46 <dobbie>	I set up Mum on elementary.....what a fucking drama

Feb 07 19:55:04 <smoke>	I like KDE for normies
Feb 07 19:55:11 <iDanoo>	yeah, pretty simple

Feb 07 19:57:58 <smoke>	Window Chef is a stacking window manager that cooks windows with orders from the Waitron
Feb 07 19:58:00 <smoke>	Nope

Feb 07 19:58:42 <iDanoo>	like popups
Feb 07 19:58:47 <iDanoo>	I mean, just raw i3wm on arch
Feb 07 19:58:49 <smoke>	thought about bsp and a few others
Feb 07 19:58:50 <iDanoo>	no fancy DM
Feb 07 19:58:57 <iDanoo>	DE/whatever

Feb 07 19:59:11 <iDanoo>	hahaha
Feb 07 19:59:11 <smoke>	lol
Feb 07 19:59:15 <smoke>	easy fix
Feb 07 19:59:23 <iDanoo>	shift + space was a great fix
Feb 07 19:59:33 <iDanoo>	but I feel like it goes against the theory of tiling WMs
Feb 07 19:59:36 <smoke>	for_window [title="(?i)(?:copying|deleting|moving|open)"] floating enable
Feb 07 19:59:38 <smoke>	for_window [window_role="(?i)(?:pop-up|setup|preferen*)"] floating enable
Feb 07 19:59:41 <iDanoo>	haha damn
Feb 07 19:59:44 <smoke>	LOL
Feb 07 19:59:45 <iDanoo>	if only I knew about that
Feb 07 19:59:53 <iDanoo>	I'm happy with openbox at the moment though
Feb 07 19:59:56 <smoke>	for_window [class="(?i)work"]     floating enable, move position 1052 8, resize set 860 600
Feb 07 19:59:56 <iDanoo>	so will see how long this lasts

Feb 07 20:01:07 <iDanoo>	i think it is
Feb 07 20:01:10 <iDanoo>	or xmonad
Feb 07 20:01:13 <smoke>	yea a bit
Feb 07 20:01:22 <iDanoo>	got a workmate using xmonad on arch
Feb 07 20:01:26 <smoke>	only because I had to configure our AL version of Awesome
Feb 07 20:01:27 <iDanoo>	he's bloody quick with it
Feb 07 20:01:33 <smoke>	nice
Feb 07 20:01:35 <smoke>	yea
Feb 07 20:01:42 <iDanoo>	just shortcuts for each program on a new desktop
Feb 07 20:01:43 <smoke>	both are programmers WM's
Feb 07 20:01:51 <iDanoo>	yep, I've been trying to get right into vim
Feb 07 20:01:52 <smoke>	super in depth configs
Feb 07 20:02:02 <smoke>	over the last 3 months
Feb 07 20:02:05 <iDanoo>	I mean.. I got it pretty and some cool linters and a status bar / etc
Feb 07 20:02:10 <smoke>	I've totally migrated to vim
Feb 07 20:02:10 <iDanoo>	but just can't get my head around all the keys
Feb 07 20:02:14 <iDanoo>	haha nice!
Feb 07 20:02:20 <iDanoo>	yeah I've got things like $
Feb 07 20:02:26 <smoke>	lol yea
Feb 07 20:02:28 <iDanoo>	and sed
Feb 07 20:02:30 <smoke>	there is soo much
Feb 07 20:02:36 <iDanoo>	just can't navigate quick enough
Feb 07 20:02:37 <smoke>	slightly overwhelming
Feb 07 20:02:42 <iDanoo>	I know the {} keys and paragraphs/etc.
Feb 07 20:02:46 <smoke>	Just force yourself to use it
Feb 07 20:02:57 <iDanoo>	I can't take the productivity hit though
Feb 07 20:03:02 <smoke>	You'll get the hang of navigation fairly quickly
Feb 07 20:03:06 <smoke>	Fair
Feb 07 20:03:27 <smoke>	I find using geany or others to be very difficult now
Feb 07 20:03:29 <iDanoo>	Especailly at 3am when you get a call saying shits tanking the environment and you need to push something asap
Feb 07 20:03:31 <iDanoo>	hahaha
Feb 07 20:03:37 <smoke>	after getting so used to it
Feb 07 20:03:44 <iDanoo>	Yeah, we primarily use Phpstorm
Feb 07 20:03:47 <iDanoo>	which is so damn heavy
Feb 07 20:03:54 <iDanoo>	I quite liked Atom with a few custom plugins
Feb 07 20:03:55 <smoke>	Oh god yea
Feb 07 20:03:56 <iDanoo>	but still, heavy.
Feb 07 20:04:03 <smoke>	atom was what I was using
Feb 07 20:04:05 <smoke>	but yea
Feb 07 20:04:08 <smoke>	heavy as shit
Feb 07 20:04:11 <smoke>	not so nice
Feb 07 20:04:12 <iDanoo>	Another workmate uses i3-gaps with spacemacs
Feb 07 20:04:22 <iDanoo>	it's so nice seeing people using real custom arch builds haha
Feb 07 20:04:28 <smoke>	plus doesnt work well with the other stuff I use
Feb 07 20:04:31 <iDanoo>	yeah true
Feb 07 20:04:35 <iDanoo>	I mean our work laptops only have 8gb ram
Feb 07 20:04:38 <smoke>	Dude
Feb 07 20:04:40 <smoke>	soacemacs
Feb 07 20:04:43 <smoke>	spacemacs
Feb 07 20:04:44 <iDanoo>	and we run a vagrant box which chews up 2gb
Feb 07 20:04:47 <iDanoo>	fuck spacemacs
Feb 07 20:04:49 <smoke>	I used that for a while
Feb 07 20:04:51 <iDanoo>	I swear it's slower than atom
Feb 07 20:04:55 <smoke>	but then was like wait
Feb 07 20:04:57 <iDanoo>	especially with all the stuff enabled
Feb 07 20:04:59 <smoke>	yep
Feb 07 20:05:02 <smoke>	totally
Feb 07 20:05:05 <iDanoo>	I watch him search for files
Feb 07 20:05:10 <iDanoo>	and i kind of laugh inside
Feb 07 20:05:13 <smoke>	and its literally vim.. but not
Feb 07 20:05:16 <iDanoo>	yeah hahahaha
Feb 07 20:05:17 <smoke>	why bother
Feb 07 20:05:20 <iDanoo>	you can do similar in vim
Feb 07 20:05:21 <smoke>	fuck lisp
Feb 07 20:05:24 <iDanoo>	with 1/10th the setup
Feb 07 20:05:27 <smoke>	yep

Feb 07 20:06:18 <iDanoo>	heaps of support
Feb 07 20:06:22 <smoke>	vim-plug is where its at these days
Feb 07 20:06:24 <iDanoo>	oh yeah?
Feb 07 20:06:33 <iDanoo>	Well I have a fresh vim after I installed 2017-12

Feb 07 20:07:41 <smoke>	yea man, it takes a bit to actually get comfortable
Feb 07 20:07:42 <iDanoo>	I just like being able to C&P things

Feb 07 20:08:06 <iDanoo>	ctrl+v - block visual mode
Feb 07 20:08:10 <iDanoo>	:D
Feb 07 20:08:16 <smoke>	I swapped
Feb 07 20:08:24 <smoke>	Ctrl+v is normal visual
Feb 07 20:08:27 <smoke>	v is block
Feb 07 20:08:31 <iDanoo>	ah sweet
Feb 07 20:08:32 <smoke>	I use block faar more
Feb 07 20:08:40 <iDanoo>	Yep I bet

Feb 07 20:08:47 <smoke>	for whole lines
Feb 07 20:08:51 <iDanoo>	wow
Feb 07 20:08:57 <iDanoo>	I really need to get used to it
Feb 07 20:08:57 <smoke>	way more than base visuall
Feb 07 20:09:03 <iDanoo>	After I got people using arch
Feb 07 20:09:04 <smoke>	yea

Feb 07 20:15:03 <iDanoo>	ah cool
Feb 07 20:15:08 <iDanoo>	I think I just need to get used to stock commands first
Feb 07 20:15:12 <iDanoo>	then slowly add things to speed it up
Feb 07 20:15:22 <smoke>	yep
Feb 07 20:15:41 <smoke>	I dont really need much more than the default
Feb 07 20:15:46 <iDanoo>	ok screw it

Feb 10 10:51:14 <dobbie>	Hey fellas, can you all email me at mattdobson2001@gmail.com wih your current email and your prefered name for the new upcoming AL emails
Feb 10 10:51:19 <dobbie>	lol Yeah, agreed
Feb 10 10:51:22 <iDanoo>	I switched to true OS bsd yesterday , I am waiting for good kernel suitable to my laptop , 3.8 - 4.14 heats my laptop â€¦ I dont like to use windows
Feb 10 10:51:24 <iDanoo>	switch to UEFI and GPT hoping for better firmware integration with my hardware , doesnt help at all
Feb 10 10:51:28 <iDanoo>	Like what the fuck is that?
Feb 10 10:51:35 <iDanoo>	haha
Feb 10 10:51:38 <dobbie>	A troll perhaps?
Feb 10 10:51:43 <iDanoo>	yeah sounds like it
Feb 10 10:51:48 <iDanoo>	or someone who has NO clue
Feb 10 10:51:51 <dobbie>	LOL< fuck em
Feb 10 10:52:11 <iDanoo>	I really wanted to /dev/null, but don't want to be a dick if he's genuine and just sucks at english/linux
Feb 10 10:52:23 <iDanoo>	I have an idea, hold up
Feb 10 10:52:29 <dobbie>	I am tempted too but I think it's his lack of english
Feb 10 10:53:17 <iDanoo>	https://www.q4os.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2062
Feb 10 10:53:19 <iDanoo>	HAHA
Feb 10 10:53:52 <iDanoo>	Once again, he didn't answer any helpful questions
Feb 10 10:53:56 <dobbie>	okay, lack of knowledge it is....
Feb 10 10:53:57 <dobbie>	lol
Feb 10 10:54:15 <iDanoo>	That was way too easy to find
Feb 10 10:54:23 <dobbie>	just googled his username?
Feb 10 10:54:29 <iDanoo>	yeah basically
Feb 10 10:54:31 <iDanoo>	archlabs then q4os
Feb 10 10:54:37 <iDanoo>	then some other random stuff unrelated
Feb 10 10:54:42 <iDanoo>	looks like he just wants people to fix the issue for him
Feb 10 10:54:48 <iDanoo>	and magically push a kernel fix specifically for him
Feb 10 10:54:51 <dobbie>	He must be trying to find a solution by using other distros
Feb 10 10:54:58 <iDanoo>	I bet it's just a blocked fan
Feb 10 10:55:04 <iDanoo>	and MS underclocks to handle it
Feb 10 10:55:06 <dobbie>	There is a much worse Help Vampire than thim
Feb 10 10:55:22 <iDanoo>	I would put money on it that it's something like that ^
Feb 10 10:55:23 <dobbie>	his name is TJ Wolf.....dumbest mother fucker I have ever encountered
Feb 10 10:55:27 <iDanoo>	Oh god
Feb 10 10:55:33 <iDanoo>	You can only sink so much time into someone
Feb 10 10:55:36 <iDanoo>	before you lose your shit haha
Feb 10 10:55:44 <dobbie>	+ he gets super angry when you don't help when he expects it
Feb 10 10:56:39 <unix121>	@dobbie I mailed you , just use unix121 for me
Feb 10 10:56:52 <dobbie>	Cheers Stav
Feb 10 10:57:11 <avnsgt[m]>	What is the user name of the troll??
Feb 10 10:58:14 <iDanoo>	ragilsatrio is the heat guy
Feb 10 10:58:44 <iDanoo>	He like gets right into distros, then shits on them for heating up his computer, then swaps to another distro and does the same thing
Feb 10 10:59:10 <avnsgt[m]>	Ok.. I have read a few of this posts, and answered one of them.
Feb 10 10:59:11 <iDanoo>	`I will wait archlabs with better kernel .`
Feb 10 10:59:24 <iDanoo>	Yeah cause our kernel is different.

Feb 10 12:19:01 <iDanoo>	hmm
Feb 10 12:19:04 <iDanoo>	we could always host our own irc server
Feb 10 12:19:06 <iDanoo>	haha
Feb 10 12:19:15 <iDanoo>	nope, I take that back.
Feb 10 12:19:19 <iDanoo>	Too much admin.
Feb 10 12:20:22 <avnsgt[m]>	Why? Why not just migrate to a full on Riot and use Matrix.org?
Feb 10 12:20:24 <iDanoo>	Although would be cool to get a cluster up
Feb 10 12:20:40 <iDanoo>	Could setup a matrix server
Feb 10 12:21:01 <iDanoo>	I just feel like IRC is much more supported
Feb 10 12:21:05 <iDanoo>	it's got like 30 years on matrix
Feb 10 12:21:07 <iDanoo>	haha
Feb 10 12:21:39 <avnsgt[m]>	IRC does have 30 years on matrix, but you have to consider the entire user base.
Feb 10 12:21:52 <iDanoo>	I think IRC still might just top matrix on that one..
Feb 10 12:21:53 <iDanoo>	I'll check
Feb 10 12:22:37 <iDanoo>	Hmmm
Feb 10 12:22:39 <avnsgt[m]>	THe younger generations will be on slack/riot and others, older will be irc/xmpp.
Feb 10 12:22:44 <iDanoo>	Yeah very true
Feb 10 12:22:46 <iDanoo>	although
Feb 10 12:22:57 <iDanoo>	I just don't want to introduce another damn chat thing
Feb 10 12:23:10 <iDanoo>	Also with kiwiirc, irc is real easy to join in on
Feb 10 12:23:46 <avnsgt[m]>	Just have to consider the overall target market..
Feb 10 12:23:51 <iDanoo>	Yeah very true
Feb 10 12:25:44 <avnsgt[m]>	Riot has a nice feature that lets  you bridge into IRC.. Connecting with the older generations, while still keeping with the younger crowd. THere might even be a way to merge the two rooms to one..
Feb 10 12:26:20 <iDanoo>	Yeah maybe
Feb 10 12:26:42 <avnsgt[m]>	No too sure, it would need some research, but depending on the APIs it may be possible.
Feb 10 12:29:19 <avnsgt[m]>	Not*

Feb 10 13:02:59 <sqamsqam>	work provided laptop
Feb 10 13:03:19 <sqamsqam>	i have no issue with it since can get by any filtering with a vpn
Feb 10 13:03:28 <sqamsqam>	just curios to why they want it?
Feb 10 13:03:33 <iDanoo>	yeah, they asked for everyones "Wifi Local Area COnnection MAC"
Feb 10 13:03:39 <iDanoo>	and some other unrelated MAC
Feb 10 13:03:41 <iDanoo>	was like.. wtf.
Feb 10 13:03:48 <iDanoo>	Yeah I think it's data tracking and mapping them in Meraki
Feb 10 13:03:57 <iDanoo>	but I use a random mac on boot
Feb 10 13:03:59 <iDanoo>	so fuck em

Feb 10 13:14:09 <iDanoo>	;)
